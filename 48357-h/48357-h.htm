<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a lovely spring day—very lovely
at Viamede, where Mrs. Travilla—or
Grandma Elsie, as some of her young
friends loved to call her—was seated under
the orange trees on the flower-bespangled
lawn, with her father and his wife, her
cousins, Mr. Ronald Lilburn and Annis, his
wife, her children, and some of the more distant
relatives and friends gathered about her
or wandering here and there at some little
distance on the same beautiful lawn.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful place this is!” exclaimed
Zoe, breaking a pause in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her husband, “but I am thinking
it is about time we returned to our more
northern homes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it is,” said his grandfather, Mr.
Dinsmore.</p>

<p>“I also; I feel as if I had been neglecting
my business shamefully,” sighed Chester.</p>

<p>At that Dr. Harold shook his head smilingly.
“Don’t let conscience reproach you,
Chester, for what has probably saved you
from invalidism and perhaps prolonged your
life for years.”</p>

<p>“Well, cousin doctor, you will surely admit
that I am well enough to go back to work
now?” laughed Chester.</p>

<p>“Perhaps; but wait a little till you hear a
plan I have to propose. Mother,” he went
on, turning to her, “I met a gentleman yesterday
who has just returned from California,
which he pronounces the loveliest,
most salubrious section of our country, and
what he had to say of its climate and scenery
has aroused in me a strong desire to visit
it, taking you all with me—especially those
of our party who are my patients.”</p>

<p>“Hardly at this time of year; though, I
suppose, Harold,” she replied, giving him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
look of loving appreciation, “it would seem
wiser to move in a northerly direction before
the summer heats come on.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, this gentleman says the
summers there are really more enjoyable
than the winters, and the map shows us that
Santa Barbara is a few degrees farther north
than we are here, and San Francisco some
few degrees north of that. It is not a tropical,
but a semi-tropical climate, and for
every month in the year you need the same
sort of clothing that you wear in New York
or Chicago in the winter. He tells me that
for two-thirds of the year the weather is
superb—the heat rare above 68 degrees
and almost always tempered by a refreshing
breeze from the ocean or the mountains.
Sometimes there are fogs, but they don’t
bring with them the raw, searching dampness
of our eastern ones. Indeed, from all I have
heard and read of the climate I think it
would be most beneficial for these patients
of mine,” Harold concluded, glancing smilingly
from one to another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“And a most enjoyable trip for us all, I
have no doubt,” said Captain Raymond.</p>

<p>“How about the expense?” queried Chester.</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” said the captain.
“I claim the privilege of bearing it for
the party. How many will go?”</p>

<p>“The Dolphin could hardly be made to
hold us all, papa,” laughed Grace.</p>

<p>“No; nor to cross the plains and mountains,”
returned her father with an amused
smile. “We would go by rail and let those
who prefer going home at once do so in our
yacht.”</p>

<p>At that Edward Travilla, standing near,
looked greatly pleased. “That is a most kind
and generous offer, captain,” he said, “and I
for one shall be very glad to accept it.”</p>

<p>“We will consider that you have done so,”
returned the captain, “and you can begin engaging
your passengers as soon as you like.
But I am forgetting that I should first learn
how many will accept my invitation for the
land trip. Grandpa and Grandma Dinsmore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
you will do so, will you not? And you,
mother, Cousin Ronald and Cousin Annis?”</p>

<p>There was a slight demur, a little asking
and answering of questions back and forth,
which presently ended in a pleased acceptance
of the captain’s generous invitation by
all who had come with him in the Dolphin—Violet,
his wife, with their children, Elsie
and Ned; his older daughters, Lucilla and
Grace, with Chester, Lucilla’s husband, and
Grace’s lover, Dr. Harold Travilla; Evelyn,
Max’s wife, and last but not least in importance,
Grandma Elsie, Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore—her
father and his wife—and the
cousins—Mr. Ronald Lilburn and Annis, his
wife.</p>

<p>All had become greatly interested, and the
talk was very cheery and animated. Different
routes to California were discussed, and
it was presently decided to go by the Southern
Pacific, taking the cars at New Orleans—and
that they would make an early start,
as would those who were to return home in
the Dolphin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“May I take my Tiny along, papa?” asked
Elsie, standing by his side with the little
monkey on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“I think not, daughter,” he replied; “she
would be very apt to get lost while we are
wandering about in that strange part of the
country.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I’ll have to leave her here
till we come back; and do you think any of
the servants can be trusted to take good care
of her and not let her get lost in the woods,
papa?” asked the little girl in tones quivering
with emotion.</p>

<p>“If you will trust me to take care of her
she can go home with us in the yacht and live
at Ion till you come for her,” said Zoe.
Then, turning to Ned, who was there with
his pet: “And I make you the same offer for
your Tee-tee,” she added, “for, of course, if
Elsie’s can’t be trusted to go to California,
neither can yours.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Aunt Zoe,” both children answered,
but in tones that told of regret that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
even for a time they must resign the care of
their pets to another.</p>

<p>“And we’ll have Tiny and Tee-tee in the
yacht with us. How nice that will be!” exclaimed
little Eric Leland. “They are fine,
amusing little fellows, and you may be sure,
Elsie and Ned, that we will take good care
of them.”</p>

<p>“And be willing to give them back to us
when we get home?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“Honest enough to do so, I hope, whether
we’re willing or not,” laughed Eric.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course we would,” said his sister,
Alie, “for we are honest folks; but I’m glad
we can have the cute little monkeys with us
even for awhile.”</p>

<p>“On the yacht you will, but I think we’ll
have them at Ion after we get home,” said
Lily Travilla, the little daughter of Edward
and Zoe, “because it’s papa and mamma who
have promised to take care of them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Elsie, “and I’m sure Uncle
Edward and Aunt Zoe will be good to them—so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
good that I’m most afraid they’ll grow
fonder of them than of Ned and me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I don’t think there is any danger
of that,” said Zoe, “and if they should, you
can soon win their hearts back again by your
love and kindness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do believe we can, Aunt Zoe; for
the dear little things love us now, I’m sure,”
cried Elsie, giving Tiny a hug and a loving
pat.</p>

<p>But the older people were chatting about
the necessary preparations for the journey,
and the children grew quiet to listen. Their
plans were laid in a few moments, and within
twenty-four hours all embarked for New Orleans,
in the same boat, and on reaching that
city the two companies parted, Edward and
his charges starting eastward in the Dolphin,
Captain Raymond and his taking a westward-bound
train on the Southern Pacific.</p>

<p>The little company, especially the younger
ones, were in fine spirits; they were pleasant
companions for each other, the weather was
fine, and the prospect of sight-seeing before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
them quite delightful. The children had
many questions to ask about what they
should see in California, which the older people,
especially their father, were kindly ready
to answer.</p>

<p>“At what place will we stop first, papa?”
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“At Coronado Beach, which is not very
far from Los Angeles. We will take rooms
at the Hotel del Coronado, which is an immense
building, yet very homelike and delightful.
It has an inner court, with trees,
flowers and vines, and around that court
many suites of rooms, each with its own bath
and sitting-room, so that a party of guests
such as ours can be very comfortable and as
private as they please.”</p>

<p>“And if they don’t want to be very private
I suppose they can mingle with other folks,
can’t they, papa?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; there is almost every kind
of amusement that is found elsewhere.
Probably fishing and yachting, walking and
driving along the beach, will suit us as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
or better than anything else; there is a drive
of twelve miles along the beach at low tide.”</p>

<p>“But I fear we will find it too warm for
outdoor sports at this time of year,” remarked
Mrs. Dinsmore.</p>

<p>“No, grandma, I think not,” said Dr. Harold.
“I have been told the summer climate
is better than the winter—never too warm
for comfort, dry and tempered as it is by the
ocean breeze. You do not find there the raw,
searching dampness felt at Eastern seaside
resorts; but I’m told it is too cold for the
comfort of invalids during the March rains.
They are happily over now, and I think that
even our invalids will find the weather comfortably
warm.”</p>

<p>“And comfortably cool?” queried his
mother, giving him a proudly affectionate
look and smile.</p>

<p>“I think the ocean breeze will make it
that, mother,” he answered, returning her
smile with one as full of affection as her
own.</p>

<p>“I do believe we are going to have a delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
time,” exclaimed Lucilla in joyous
tones; “everything will be so new and fresh—lovely
scenery, beautiful plants and flowers,
and the climate all that one could desire.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you will not be disappointed,
daughter,” the captain said; “but California
is not heaven and you must expect some unpleasantnesses.”</p>

<p>“I hope there won’t be sicknesses,” said
Grace.</p>

<p>“No,” said Evelyn sportively, “we must
all try to keep well that our good doctor may
not be robbed of his vacation.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mrs. Raymond,” said Harold,
with a bow and smile, “I sincerely hope you
will all keep well for your own sakes more
than mine.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure we will all do our best
in that line, Harold, and even more for our
own sakes than for yours,” laughed his sister,
Violet.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” he returned. “Having persuaded
you all to take the trip I am extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
desirous that it may prove beneficial.”</p>

<p>They had been talking during a pause in
the movement of the train, and now, as it
started on again, they relapsed into silence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> arrived at Coronado Beach, tired
with their journey but full of delight with the
beauty of their surroundings. On the morning
after their arrival they were gathered
upon one of the galleries, taking a very interested
view of the strange and beautiful
scenery spread out before them. The near
prospect was of lovely grounds forming the
inner court of the hotel, grass, trees and
hedges of lovely green, borders and ovals and
beds of marguerites, long lines and curves of
marigolds, and a fountain encircled by calla-lilies.
It was beautiful. And farther away
they could see other lovely gardens, rocky
wastes, lofty mountains, and the ocean with
distant sails upon it; the beach with foaming
waves breaking on it, and Point Loma, grandly
guarding the harbor on the right.</p>

<p>“There must be a grand view from the top
of that promontory,” remarked Chester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said the captain, “and perhaps a
call there would be as good a beginning of
our peregrinations as we could make. Point
Loma commands one of the most remarkable
views in the world; an immense prospect and
very interesting in its details. I suppose you
would all like to go?” he added inquiringly,
and with a kindly glance from one to another.</p>

<p>No one seemed at all inclined to reject the
offered treat, carriages were ordered, and in
a few minutes they were on their way.</p>

<p>There was no disappointment; the view
from the top of the rocky promontory, Point
Loma, was all they had been led to expect; a
view of miles of old ocean, blue and sparkling
in the sunshine, bearing distant vessels on its
bosom; on the land ranges on ranges of mountains;
away in the distance to the South another
promontory—the Point of Rocks, in
Mexico. They drove along the narrow ridge
of the promontory to the lighthouse, and
found the view very fine from there.</p>

<p>“How beautiful is that wide, curving coast
line!” remarked Grandma Elsie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, mamma,” assented Violet, “and the
ranges on ranges of hills and mountains.
And there, see, are snow-peaks beyond them.
What mountains are they, my dear?”</p>

<p>“San Bernardino and San Jacinto,” replied
the captain; “and that flat-topped one is
Table Mountain, in Mexico.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a grand view, this!” remarked Mr.
Lilburn, in tones of delight.</p>

<p>“Yes, one of the finest in the world,” responded
the captain. “What a perfect crescent
is that ocean beach, and how singular is
the formation of North and South Coronado
Beach! Notice the entrance to this harbor
here along Point Loma, where we are standing,
and on the spacious inner bay, the towns
of San Diego, and National City; notice
the lowlands and heights outside sprinkled
with houses, gardens, vineyards and orchards.”</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful scene,” said Mrs. Rose
Dinsmore; “it alone is enough to repay us for
our long journey.”</p>

<p>“Yes, grandma,” responded Violet, “especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as the journey itself was really delightful.”</p>

<p>“So it was,” responded several voices.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it paid even for giving up
my Tiny for a few weeks,” said little Elsie.
“Are we going anywhere else to-day, papa?”
she asked, turning to her father.</p>

<p>“That is a question I have not considered
yet,” he answered, “but I think that by the
time we get back to our hotel and eat our
dinner, it will be rather late for another
trip.”</p>

<p>“I think so; especially for those of our
party who are my patients,” said Dr. Travilla.
“For a time I must ask them to avoid
both the evening and the early morning air.”</p>

<p>“And such is their confidence in your medical
wisdom and skill that they will be very
apt to take your advice,” remarked Lucilla,
with playful look and tone.</p>

<p>“Certainly we will,” added Chester;
“where would be the use of bringing a doctor
along if his advice is not to be followed?”</p>

<p>“I’m very hungry,” put in little Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
“Uncle Harold, wouldn’t it be good for us
to have something to eat?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, Ned, I highly approve of that
suggestion,” laughed the doctor, “and there
are lunch baskets in our carriages that will
no doubt yield all that is needed to satisfy our
appetites.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw them, Uncle Harold, and so
I knew we didn’t need to go hungry,” replied
Ned. Then, turning to his father, “May I
go and get the baskets, papa?” he asked. “I
s’pose we’ll have to eat out here.”</p>

<p>“No doubt we can eat comfortably enough
sitting here on the rocks,” replied his father;
“but the baskets are too heavy for a boy of
your size to carry. We will get one of our
drivers to do that.” Then addressing the
party, “Judging by my own feelings, ladies
and gentlemen, I suppose you are all ready
for lunch?”</p>

<p>There was a general assent, and presently
they were regaling themselves with a very appetizing
meal.</p>

<p>That concluded, they re-entered their carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and had a delightful drive back to the
Hotel del Coronado, where they passed a
pleasant evening, then retired early for a
comfortable night’s rest.</p>

<p>The next day was the Sabbath. Our party
attended morning service in the nearest
church, and in the afternoon spent an hour or
more in Bible study together. After that little
Elsie, Bible in hand, drew near Mrs. Travilla.</p>

<p>“Grandma,” she said, “I want to ask you
about this verse in Revelations. Shall I read
it to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear; let me hear it,” replied Grandma
Elsie, and the child read in low, sweet
tones:</p>

<p>“‘He that hath an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit saith unto the churches: To him
that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
manna, and will give him a white stone,
and in the stone a new name written, which
no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
it.’”</p>

<p>The little girl paused, closed her Bible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
putting her hand in her pocket drew out a
small white stone.</p>

<p>“See, grandma,” she said, “I picked this
up yesterday when we were out and it reminded
me of that verse. Please, grandma,
tell me what it means.”</p>

<p>“I will do the best I can, darling,” was the
sweet-toned reply. “The white stone was the
symbol of acquittal. When a man had been
accused or suspected of some crime, tried for
it and found innocent, the judge would give
him a white stone, and he could show that as
proof that he had been pronounced innocent.
The white stone was also the symbol of victory
and honor, and was given to brave soldiers
coming home from battles for their
country.”</p>

<p>“Then they would be very proud to show
it, I suppose,” said Elsie. “But was that all
the use they had for such stones, grandma?”</p>

<p>“No; they were used as a symbol of friendship.
A single stone would be cut in two, one
man would take one half, his friend the other,
each would write his name on the piece he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
held, then they would exchange them, each
keeping his piece with his friend’s name upon
it, as proof and pledge of that friend’s love.
They might be so separated afterwards as not
to see or hear from each other for years, and
perhaps, if they met again, not be able to
recognize each other, because of changed appearances,
but the stone would help them to
prove their identity and give them the joy of
renewed friendship. And when they died
their sons would inherit those valuable stones,
which would serve as helpers in keeping up
the friendship of their fathers.”</p>

<p>Elsie sat for a moment in thoughtful silence,
then turning to her grandma, with a
sweet smile: “That was a nice lesson,” she
said. “Thank you very much for it, grandma.”</p>

<p>“What was that, daughter?” asked the captain,
approaching them at that moment. In
reply Elsie showed her stone and repeated
what her grandma had been telling her.</p>

<p>“That was a very good lesson,” said her
father. “Keep the little white stone, daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and when you look at it remember the
Master’s promise given with it—look to Him
for strength to overcome, and you will not
fail. He says to each one of His children:
‘Fear thou not; for I am with thee; be not
dismayed, for I am thy God; I will
strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea,
I will uphold thee with the right hand of my
righteousness.’ Again and again in that same
chapter He repeats His gracious admonition
to His people not to fear, because they are
His—He is their God and will help them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is lovely, papa, lovely to belong to
Him and know that He will bring us safely
all the way through this world to the home
with Him that He has prepared for us
above!” exclaimed the little girl in joyous
tones, her eyes shining with happiness.</p>

<p>At the moment Violet came in from the
gallery, whither all the rest of the party had
already gone.</p>

<p>“Come, mamma dear,” she said, “we want
your company, and have a comfortable chair
placed ready for you. Plenty of room and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
warm welcome, Levis, for you and our little
daughter, also,” she added, turning her sweet,
smiling face toward her husband.</p>

<p>All three promptly accepted her invitation,
and found it very delightful to gaze upon the
beautiful grounds just below them, and the
sparkling, restless ocean beyond, also to inhale
the delightful sea breeze—all in the
pleasant company of those whose conversation
was both interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>The summons to the tea table presently
called them away from that pleasant spot, but
they returned to it until the approach of bedtime;
then with cordial and kindly good-nights
they separated.</p>

<p>But Lucilla came back presently to find her
father pacing the gallery to and fro as was his
wont at home. Pausing in his walk, he welcomed
her with a smile, put an arm about her
and gave her a kiss that seemed to say she
was very dear to him.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said, “you were so kind to
bring us all here to this lovely place.”</p>

<p>“Kind to myself as well as to others,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
said with a smile; “I am very glad, daughter,
to know that you are enjoying it.”</p>

<p>“I am, father dear, more than I can find
words to express, as is Chester, also; and I
think the change is improving his health.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so, and hope he will go home
entirely recovered. Ah, who is this?” as another
girlish figure came gliding toward
them.</p>

<p>“Another of your daughters, father,” answered
a sweet-toned voice; “I didn’t know
you had a companion—though I might have
guessed it—and I wanted a bit of chat about
your absent son. Isn’t it time for letters?”</p>

<p>“Hardly, Eva, my dear, though possibly
we may hear to-morrow or next day,” replied
the captain, putting an arm about her and
drawing her close to his side.</p>

<p>“I wish Max could get a furlough and join
us here,” said Lucilla. “I feel almost mean,
Eva, to be enjoying the society of my husband
while yours is so far away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lu, dear, don’t feel so,” returned
Evelyn; “your happiness certainly does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
make mine any less; no, it makes it more;
because, loving you, I rejoice in your happiness.”</p>

<p>They chatted but a few moments longer,
then bidding the captain good-night, hastened
away to their own rooms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Travilla</span>, coming out the next morning
upon that part of the gallery where their
party had spent the previous evening, found
Mr. Lilburn and the captain pacing to and
fro, chatting and laughing as if enjoying their
promenade.</p>

<p>“You see we are ahead of you, Harold,”
said the captain, when morning greetings had
been exchanged.</p>

<p>“Yes; very much?” asked Harold.</p>

<p>“Enough for a stroll around this great
building to note its size and architectural features.
’Tis an immense pile and well arranged
for comfort and convenience.”</p>

<p>“And in a delightful situation,” supplemented
Mr. Lilburn.</p>

<p>“I agree with you both and am entirely
willing to spend some days or weeks in it if
you wish,” returned Harold; “provided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
situation agrees with my patients, as I hope
and expect it will,” he added.</p>

<p>Just then Lucilla, Evelyn and Grace added
themselves to the little group, and pleasant
morning greetings were exchanged, the captain
bestowing a fatherly caress upon each
daughter—Evelyn being as affectionately
greeted as either of the other two.</p>

<p>A few moments later they were joined by
the rest of their party, and all descended together
to the dining-room to partake of an
excellent breakfast. Soon after leaving the
table they were out for the day’s sight-seeing
and adventures. They visited parks, gardens,
a museum, an ostrich farm, and a number
of other attractive places, then took a fine
drive along the beach, returning in time for
the evening meal at their pleasant house of
entertainment.</p>

<p>So delightful did they find Hotel del Coronado
that they lingered there for a week.</p>

<p>Then they left it for San Diego, which they
found wonderfully beautiful, with one of the
finest harbors in the world. It was delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to sit and gaze upon the blue, sunlit bay, and
breathe the delicious sea breeze.</p>

<p>Then there were most enjoyable drives to
be taken, visiting various attractive spots
within a few miles’ distance.</p>

<p>One day they drove to Lakeside, twenty-two
miles away, where they ate a good dinner
at the hotel, then wandered across the mesa
in its rear, and had a lovely view of its little
lake.</p>

<p>Another day they drove into the Monte, a
large park of a thousand acres. There were
great trees—elders, willows, sycamores and
live-oaks with enormous trunks, with plenty
of flowers underneath them and upon the
rocks, wild peonies, with variegated leaves,
wild galiardia, tiny starry white flowers,
pretty forget-me-nots, and others too numerous
to mention. Many kinds of beautiful
ferns, also.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a different drive for
every day in the week, all beautiful and enjoyable.
So a week passed most pleasantly,
then they took the Surf line from San Diego<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to Los Angeles. It was a seventy-mile ride,
but with so much that was interesting to see
and gaze upon, and such delicious air to
breathe, that it did not seem a long or wearisome
trip. There was the great ocean, with
its curling, sparkling waves, and seals and
porpoises frolicking in the water, gulls circling
above them, and from the ground flocks
of birds starting up in affright at the approach
of the train. Then when the train
carried them away from the view of the ocean
there were the wonderful groves of great
trees, carpets of wild flowers, and the towns
of Santa Ana and Anaheim.</p>

<p>“What is the name of the place we are going
to, papa?” asked Ned, as they drew near
the end of their short journey.</p>

<p>“’Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles,”
replied the captain, gravely enough
but with a gleam of fun in his eye.</p>

<p>“What a long name!” cried Ned. “I
should think they would have to make it
shorter sometimes when they’re in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes it is called ‘The City of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the Angels,’ but even that is too long; so it
commonly goes by name of Los Angeles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s better,” said Ned; “just a long
enough name, I think.”</p>

<p>They found Los Angeles a handsome city,
environed by gardens filled with beautiful
flowers. They spent a few days there, then
went on to Pasadena, nine miles from Los
Angeles, hearing that it was eight hundred
feet higher and the air much drier; information
which drew from Dr. Harold the opinion
that it would be much more beneficial for his
invalids.</p>

<p>They found it a very Eden-like place, situated
in the beautiful San Gabriel Valley,
and at the foot of the Sierra Madre range of
mountains.</p>

<p>“Pasadena, ‘the Crown of the Valley,’”
murmured Grandma Elsie delightedly, from
the carriage window, as they drove to their
hotel.</p>

<p>“It looks a veritable paradise,” said Violet;
“it reminds me of a description of Pasadena
I heard given by a lady at the Hotel del Coronado.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
She said one would find plenty of
flowers in bloom, but at the same time you
would need to wear flannels and sealskin
sacks; there would be snow-capped mountains
and orange blossoms; the trees are green
all the year and you go outdoors in December
to get warm; where rats build in the trees
and squirrels live in the ground with owls.”</p>

<p>“And where the boys climb up hill on
burros and slide down hills on wheels,”
laughed Grace. “I hope we shall see some of
those funny things and doings.”</p>

<p>“I hope we shall,” said Lucilla, “and I
particularly want to see the hedges of calla-lilies,
geraniums and heliotrope.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we are likely to stay long
enough for you all to see whatever there is to
be seen,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am glad we don’t have to hurry
away,” remarked Grace in a blithe and
cheery tone.</p>

<p>“As we all are, I think,” said Grandma
Elsie. “I don’t know who could fail to desire
to stay awhile in so lovely a place as this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“And we will have nothing to call us away
until we are all ready to go,” said Captain
Raymond.</p>

<p>But their arrival at their house of entertainment
now brought the conversation to a
close.</p>

<p>They found Pasadena so charming that
they lingered there week after week. The
town was beautiful, protected on three sides
by mountain ranges and surrounded by groves
and gardens, trees and hedges. There were
roses clambering to the tops of houses and
covered by tens of thousands of blossoms, and
there were passion vines completely covering
the arbors. There were hedges made of
the honeysuckle, the pomegranite and the
heliotrope. Marengo Avenue they found
lined on both sides by the beautiful pepper
tree.</p>

<p>There is a fine hotel called The Raymond,
but it was closed at this time; so that our
friends, though attracted by the name, could
see only the grounds and the outside of the
buildings. It is set upon a hill commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a fine view, and in the winter season is filled
to overflowing, but it is always closed in
April. They found the hill on which it
stands an excellent point of view of the country,
and itself a mountain of bloom, color and
fragrance; and it was evident that the views
from the windows and broad verandas—views
of orchards, gardens, pretty villas, purple
foothills and snowy ranges, must be fine
indeed.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful place it is,” exclaimed
little Elsie when they had gone about the
house, viewing it and grounds from side to
side. “I wish it was open so we could stay
here. Papa, it has our name; are the folks
who own it related to us?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, daughter, but I hardly think
so; it is not an uncommon name,” replied the
captain.</p>

<p>“It’s a good name; I don’t want any better,”
said Ned sturdily.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you are satisfied, and I hope you
will never do anything to disgrace it,” said
his father, with a gratified smile and an affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
pat of the small hand which happened
to be held in his at the moment.</p>

<p>Our party found a great deal to interest
them in and about Pasadena. There were the
fine hotels, the pleasant boarding houses, the
Public Library in the town, and three miles
away the old mission of San Gabriel. They
made various trips in the vicinity of the town—to
Mt. San Antonio, ten miles away, but
none too far for a little trip, they thought;
also to Mt. San Jacinto, whose height is
twelve thousand feet above the Pacific.</p>

<p>Our friends found Pasadena so delightful
that they lingered there for some weeks.
Then they passed on in a southerly direction
till they reached the lovely city of Santa Barbara,
where they lingered still longer, finding
the place itself wonderfully attractive and the
many drives in the vicinity delightful. They
found that there were as many as twenty-eight
distinct and beautiful drives, and almost
every day they tried one or more of them.
They greatly enjoyed the scenery—the mountains,
the valleys, the beautiful villas, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
their trees, shrubs, vines and flowers, one
grape-vine in especial with a trunk eight
inches in diameter, with foliage covering ten
thousand square feet, and which they were
told yielded in one year twelve thousand
pounds of grapes.</p>

<p>Another drive took them to the lighthouse,
where from the balcony there was a fine view
of the fields below, the blue sea beyond them,
and the blue sky overhead. There was hardly
anything which the ladies of our party and
little Elsie enjoyed more than the sight of the
vast profusion of roses—hundreds of varieties
and vines covering many feet of arbor or
veranda.</p>

<p>Santa Barbara proved a place hard to
leave, and they lingered there for a number of
weeks, all of them—especially those who had
been on the invalid list-feeling that they
were constantly gaining in health and
strength. News from their homes was
favorable to their stay; everything seemed to
be going on very well without them; so they
yielded to the fascinations of this Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
fairy land and lingered weeks longer than
they had intended when they came.</p>

<p>The summer was nearly over; they began
to think it time to be on the move toward
home, and after a little talk on the subject
decided to start the next day, go on to San
Francisco, tarry there a few days, then travel
eastward to their homes.</p>

<p>Evelyn was the most eager for the start;
it seemed so long since she had last seen her
young husband, and they were hoping he
might get a furlough and spend some weeks
with her at Crag Cottage, their pretty home
on the Hudson.</p>

<p>They tarried in San Francisco long enough
to acquaint themselves with all its beauties,
then wended their way eastward as fast as the
cars could carry them. They felt it still too
early in the season for an immediate return
to their southern homes, but they scattered to
various places in the north-some to visit
relatives, some to the seaside, while several
accepted an invitation from Evelyn to spend
some weeks at Crag Cottage. She knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
her aunt, Elsie Leland, was already there,
and had everything in order for their reception.
Grandma Elsie, Dr. Harold Travilla,
Grace Raymond and her sister, Lucilla, were
the others who accepted the invitation. But
Captain Raymond, Violet and their two
younger children expected to visit for some
weeks one of Long Island’s seaside resorts.</p>

<p>Max had written to Evelyn that he hoped
for a furlough that would enable him to join
her at their cottage and spend with her the
few weeks she would care to stay there; and
she was looking forward to that reunion with
eager delight, while journeying from far-off
California to the home of her childhood.</p>

<p>“Father and Mamma Vi,” she said to them
as they journeyed through the State of New
York, “stop with me at Crag Cottage and
make at least a little visit there. I think
you will see Max if you do. I have a
feeling that he will be there to meet us on our
arrival.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, daughter,” returned Captain
Raymond, with a look of pleasure, “I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
happy to accept your invitation if it suits my
wife to do so. What do you say, Violet, my
dear?”</p>

<p>“That I accept gladly! I shall be pleased to
see both Max and the pretty cottage; as well
as to be Eva’s guest for a few days.”</p>

<p>“And what will Elsie and I do?” asked
Ned, with a roguish look. “Go on to the
seashore by ourselves?”</p>

<p>“No, little brother, we wouldn’t any of us
be willing to trust you to do that,” laughed
Evelyn, “and large as you are, I think the
cottage can be made to hold you two in addition
to the others.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good! I’m glad of that, for I always
enjoy a visit to Crag Cottage,” cried Ned,
clapping his hands in glee.</p>

<p>“And I hope you will be often there visiting
your brother and sister,” said Evelyn,
smiling affectionately and patting the hand
he had laid upon the arm of her seat.</p>

<p>Her invitation was not extended to other
members of the party, as their plans were already
made. Mr. and Mrs. Lilburn had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
already left them to visit their relatives at
Pleasant Plains, and Mr. and Mrs. Horace
Dinsmore had announced their intention of
visiting theirs in the neighborhood of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“We will reach New York presently,” remarked
the captain, after a little, “and there
we will leave the train and go aboard the
Dolphin, if, as I have every reason to expect,
she is lying at the dock there; and we can all
journey up to Crag Cottage in her.”</p>

<p>“Which will be a pleasant change from
travelling on land in a car,” remarked
Lucilla.</p>

<p>“You will go with us, will you not, Chester?”
asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he returned heartily; “I
must leave my wife with you and hurry on
home to attend to some professional matters
that I have neglected too long in my desire to
fully recover my health.”</p>

<p>“Be careful that you don’t lose it again,”
said Dr. Travilla, warningly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, for your wife’s sake be careful,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
urged Lucilla, a look of anxiety on her usually
bright, happy face.</p>

<p>“You may trust me for that, I think,”
Chester returned laughingly. A few hours
later they reached New York, and as they
left the train Evelyn was overjoyed to find
herself in her husband’s arms. His furlough
had been granted. He had already been
aboard the Dolphin and was able to assure
them that everything there and at Crag Cottage
was in order for their reception.</p>

<p>They had already bade good-by to Mr. and
Mrs. Horace Dinsmore, who were going on
at once to Philadelphia, Chester with them
as far as that city, so the party for the Dolphin
went aboard of her without any unnecessary
delay, and immediately journeyed in her
up to their desired haven.</p>

<p>It was a short voyage, made doubly pleasant
by the happy reunion of near and dear
ones, for it was a great joy to Max to have
his wife again by his side, and father, young
stepmother, sisters and brother close at hand;
all showing delight in the reunion and great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
affection for him. The presence of Grandma
Elsie and her son, the good and lovable physician,
was no drawback upon the felicity of
any one of them.</p>

<p>And a most joyous and affectionate greeting
awaited them all on reaching their destination,
Mr. and Mrs. Leland and their sons
and daughters evidently delighted at their arrival;
a natural consequence of the many ties
of kinship existing among them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leland had done her part well; she
had capable servants under her, the house was
in beautiful order, and the table well served.
Several days passed most delightfully, mostly
on shore, though some little trips were taken
in the yacht. Then the Raymonds began to
talk of leaving, but were urged to stay on a
little longer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was early morning, the sun just peeping
over the mountain tops on the farther side
of the river, when Captain Raymond might
have been seen pacing to and fro in the beautiful
grounds of Crag Cottage. Now and then
he glanced toward the open hall door, expecting
that Lucilla would join him in his early
stroll as she so often did. Presently some
one did step out and hasten toward him. It
was not Lucilla, however, but Dr. Harold
Travilla.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Grandpa Raymond,” was
Harold’s greeting, with a bow and smile.</p>

<p>“What?” cried the captain, standing still
in surprise.</p>

<p>“A pretty little girl has just arrived,
scarcely an hour ago, and as Max claims to be
her father, I take it that Max’s father must be
her grandsire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! An astonishing bit of news! She
was not expected so soon?”</p>

<p>“No, not for some weeks yet, but the parents
are very happy over her prompt arrival.
So far both mother and child are doing
well.”</p>

<p>“That is good news; all you have told me is
good news, although it seems a little odd to
think of myself as a grandfather,” remarked
the captain with a smile. Then turning to
Lucilla, who joined them at that moment, he
told the news to her.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, “how nice! Harold, can
I go in now, speak to Eva and look at her
treasure?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” he said; “she needs rest and I
think is sleeping. We will let you in some
hours later.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I don’t want to go to her
until her physician considers it quite safe to
do so,” returned Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” said the captain, “though I
shall be pleased to get sight of my first grandchild.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she has made you a grandfather,
papa,” laughed Lucilla. “How odd that
seems!”</p>

<p>“And you, Grace and Elsie, aunts; Ned—my
little Ned—an uncle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t he be tickled!” laughed Lucilla.</p>

<p>“We will see,” laughed the captain, “for
here he comes,” as Ned was seen at that moment
approaching them in their walk.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, papa and Sister Lu,” he
cried, as he drew near. “Good-morning,
Uncle Harold.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” returned his father.
“Have you heard the news?”</p>

<p>“News, papa? No, sir; what is it?” he
asked, putting his hand into that of his father.
“Nothing bad, I guess, ’cause you look
pleased; and so do sister and uncle.”</p>

<p>“I hope you, too, will be pleased when you
hear it,” said his father. “You have a little
niece, Ned. You are an uncle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, am I? Why how did it happen?
Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Only a little baby,” laughed Lucilla.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“Brother Max and Sister Eva are her father
and mother.”</p>

<p>“And God gave her to them a little while
ago,” added their father. “And I want you
to remember to make no noise anywhere
about the house, because your Sister Eva is
not well and noise would be very apt to make
her worse.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I think I can remember to be
quiet so as not to hurt Sister Eva or wake the
baby if it is asleep. I’d like to see it, though.”</p>

<p>“I think we will all be treated to a sight of
it before very long,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Ned, “there are mamma and
Elsie on the porch. Let’s go and tell them
the good news.”</p>

<p>And away he ran, followed by his father
and Sister Lu.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, have you heard the news?”
he cried, as he came panting up the steps.</p>

<p>“That I am a grandmother and you an
uncle?” she asked, with a merry little laugh.</p>

<p>“Why, no, mamma, you are not old enough
to be that,” exclaimed Elsie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, indeed!” cried Ned. “But papa is a
grandfather and Lu and Grace and Elsie are
aunts and I’m an uncle. Oh, isn’t it funny?”</p>

<p>“I hope you will be a well-behaved uncle
and not make your little niece ashamed of
you,” laughed Violet.</p>

<p>“I guess she won’t be,” returned Ned.
“Anyhow, not till she gets bigger. She’s just
a baby now, papa says.”</p>

<p>Captain Raymond and Lucilla were now
coming up the porch steps and at the same
moment Max stepped out from the hall door.
He was looking very happy.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, father,” he said. “Good-morning,
Mamma Vi, and all of you. Father,
I suppose Harold has told you the news?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear boy; very pleasant news,
though it seems to add something to my age
to know myself a grandfather,” returned the
captain with a smile, and taking Max’s extended
hand in a warm pressure.</p>

<p>“What did you choose a girl for, Brother
Max?” asked Ned. “I should think you’d
rather have a boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, little brother,” laughed Max. “I’m
glad it is a girl, and always shall be glad, if
she grows up to be just like her mother, as I
hope she will.”</p>

<p>“I hope so too, Max, and I am well pleased
that she is a girl,” said Lucilla, “but I am
glad that father and mother had a boy first
so that I have always had an older brother to
look up to.”</p>

<p>“And you have really looked up to him?”
laughed Max. “I haven’t always known it,
and certainly have not always been worthy
of it.”</p>

<p>Just then they were joined by Grandma
Elsie and her daughter, Mrs. Leland, with
her husband and children.</p>

<p>All had heard the news and were full of the
subject. The ladies and children wanted to
see the little newcomer, but that could not be
for the present without running the risk of
disturbing its mother, and just then came the
summons to the breakfast table.</p>

<p>Dr. Harold was with them there, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
being questioned spoke in a cheerful, hopeful
way of his patient.</p>

<p>“I left her asleep,” he said, “and looking
very peaceful and comfortable, the bit lassie
reposing by her side. The nurse seems a
capable one and I think will take the best care
of both mother and babe.”</p>

<p>“When can we see it, Uncle Harold?”
asked little Elsie.</p>

<p>“After its mother wakes yours or mine will
probably carry it out into the dressing-room
for a few minutes, and then if you two will
engage to be very quiet you may go in there
and take a peep at the little nameless stranger,”
replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“Nameless!” exclaimed Elsie. “Oh,
Brother Max, what are you going to name
it?”</p>

<p>“Its mother shall name it. I am sure she
has the best right,” replied Max.</p>

<p>“So I think,” said his father. “Violet, my
dear, how soon will you be ready for our trip
down the river?”</p>

<p>“I think I can make ready in an hour or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
two at any time,” Violet answered with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, don’t think of leaving us!”
exclaimed Max. “I am absolutely hungry
for a good visit with you; and you have had
sea air for months past. Besides, there is
plenty of room here, and of everything else
that is wanted. I hope you will all stay until
Eva and I are ready to go.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my son,” the captain said,
giving Max a look of fatherly pride and
pleasure; “a few weeks of your society will
be far from disagreeable to your old father.
So, Violet,” turning to her, “shall we accept
his invitation?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with the understanding that if at
any time we prove troublesome company we
are to be informed that such is the case and
to leave at very short notice.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure of getting such notice if
your conduct calls for it,” laughed Mrs. Leland.
“So don’t set your hearts too strongly
upon staying here as long as Max and Eva
do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is not the slightest danger of Sister
Violet earning such notice and hardly of her
children doing so,” remarked Mr. Leland,
“but I am not so sure of our own boys and
girls. Remember, my children,” glancing
around upon them, “that you are to play very
quietly when you are in or near the house
while Cousin Eva is sick.”</p>

<p>In answer there was a chorus of assurances
that they would be very careful to do nothing
to injure “dear Cousin Eva,” but everything
they could to help her to get well.</p>

<p>An hour later they were all—including
Elsie and Ned—invited to go quietly into
Cousin Eva’s dressing-room and see her new
treasure, which they found sleeping on
Grandma Elsie’s lap. They all regarded it
with great interest and pronounced it a dear,
pretty little thing.</p>

<p>“What is its name, grandma?” they asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t think she has any yet, except that
she is a little Miss Raymond,” Grandma Elsie
answered, with a smile and a loving look
down into the wee face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, because Brother Max is her
father and his name is Raymond,” said little
Elsie, “and Sisters Lu and Grace and I are
her aunts. Oh, I think it’s nice to have such
a dear little niece!”</p>

<p>“Or cousin,” said Eric Leland. “I can’t
be her uncle, but she’s my cousin, because
her mother is.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Grandma Elsie, “so she is, and
I hope you will be so kind to her that she
cannot help loving you. Now you may all
go out into the grounds and enjoy yourselves
there; far enough from the house not to disturb
your sick cousin if you want to make
any noise.”</p>

<p>“I think we will all try to be quiet, grandma,”
said Elsie, “and go far enough away not
to disturb Sister Eva with our talk.” And
with that they all passed out very quietly.</p>

<p>Elsie led the way to the summer house on
the edge of the cliff, which had always been
one of Evelyn’s favorite resorts. There they
seated themselves, enjoying the beautiful
prospect of the river and its farther shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“That baby is a dear, pretty little cousin
for us all, isn’t she?” remarked Alie Leland.</p>

<p>“To you and your sister and brothers,”
Elsie answered, with merry look and tone;
“but niece to Ned and me, you must remember,
because her father is our brother.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care,” laughed Alie. “I believe
it’s about as good to be cousin as aunt.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> awoke from a long, quiet sleep to
find her husband sitting by her side and gazing
upon her as if he thought her the greatest
of earthly treasures.</p>

<p>“Dear Max,” she said, smiling up in his
eyes, “it is so sweet to have you so close—keeping
guard over me as if I were the dearest
of earthly possessions.”</p>

<p>“That is just what you are, love,” he returned,
leaning over her and kissing lip and
cheek and brow. “And this little darling
comes next,” he added, looking down at the
sleeping babe by her side.</p>

<p>“Ah, she is a treasure, oh, such a treasure
to me—but I am sorry for your sake that she
is only a girl.”</p>

<p>“Only a girl!” he exclaimed. “I am glad
she is that. I would not have her anything
else; and I hope she will prove a second edition
of her mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear,” Eva said with a
smile. “But she must have a name, and what
shall it be?”</p>

<p>“Whatever pleases her mother,” replied
Max, returning the smile.</p>

<p>“No, I think the decision should rest with
her father,” Eva said, with her low, sweet
laugh.</p>

<p>“Shall we call her Elsie for your good, kind
aunt?” returned Max.</p>

<p>“I should like to give that token of affection
to both her and her mother,” said Evelyn,
“were it not that there are already so many
Elsies in the connection. How would Mary
do? Perhaps shortening it to Maie.”</p>

<p>“Quite well, I think,” said Max. “So let
us call her our little Maie.”</p>

<p>“Little treasure!” murmured Evelyn, gazing
upon the baby face. “Oh, Max, I feel it
very sweet to be a mother—to have a little
darling of my very own.”</p>

<p>“And I find it far from unpleasant to be
a father,” he returned gaily, “the only drawback
upon my felicity being the hard fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
that I must leave my two dearest ones so
often for my life upon the sea.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” she sighed, “I must try not to think
of that now. It is a hard thought, though I
am proud of my husband’s readiness to serve
his country.”</p>

<p>“A country well worth serving, I think,”
smiled Max; “the grandest one in the world.”</p>

<p>Doctor and nurse both came in at that
moment.</p>

<p>“In which opinion I heartily agree with
you,” said Harold, having overheard Max’s
last sentence. “But remember, my good
naval officer, that you must not talk in too
exciting a way to my patient.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not at all excited, but if you
abuse my husband I shall be,” said Evelyn,
with mirthful look and tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not abusing him or intending
to,” said Harold, “but my patient’s welfare
must always receive my first consideration.”</p>

<p>“Pleasant doctrine for me while I am the
patient,” laughed Evelyn.</p>

<p>Harold was looking at the sleeping babe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
“She’s a pretty bit lassie for one of her age,”
he said, “and I hope one of these days to
claim her as my niece.”</p>

<p>“So you may; I think you will suit very
well for an uncle,” laughed Max; “an uncle
for my child since you have ceased to be one
for myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I prefer to be your brother,” was
Harold’s response to that.</p>

<p>“Grace is much pleased with her little
niece,” said Evelyn, “and with the thought of
being an aunt; as Lucilla is, also.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the little cousins, too,” said
Grandma Elsie, coming in at that moment.
“Ah, she is waking now; see, her eyes are
open. Suppose you let me carry her into the
dressing-room again and let them refresh
their eyes with another sight of the dear little
face.”</p>

<p>“Agreed, Grandma Elsie, if you will let
me go along to witness the scene,” said Max.
“I’ll carry her very carefully on a pillow.”</p>

<p>He did so, and laid her on Grandma Elsie’s
lap, she having seated herself in a low, easy-chair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Then the children were notified and
gathered about her in an eager, excited group,
while the young father stood near looking
on.</p>

<p>“I wish I might hold her in my arms for
a little,” said Alie Leland.</p>

<p>“No, I’m too young; don’t touch me,
cousins,” the baby seemed to say.</p>

<p>“Oh, it can talk! It can talk!” cried Alie
Leland.</p>

<p>“The same way that the tee-tees did,”
laughed her brother Edward.</p>

<p>“But Cousin Ronald isn’t here,” exclaimed
several child voices.</p>

<p>“No; but Cousin Max is, and he is a ventriloquist,
too,” returned Edward, looking
smilingly at the baby’s father.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Ned,” said Max, “do you
really think my little girl is not capable of
saying a few words for herself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay she will talk fast enough
some of these days,” laughed the lad, “but I
know babies don’t talk when they are hardly
a week old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Except when there’s a ventriloquist at
hand,” said Eric.</p>

<p>“Brother Max,” exclaimed Ned, “I’m so
glad you are a ventriloquist, because I hope
you’ll make a good deal of fun for us, as
Cousin Ronald does.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it enough for me to help my little
girl to talk?” asked Max.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Ned. “Please make
her talk some more.”</p>

<p>“No, you talk, Uncle Ned,” the baby
seemed to say, and Ned laughed and shouted,
“There! she called me uncle, grandma!
She’s a nice baby, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” replied Mrs. Travilla, “and
we must all be careful to teach her only
what is good and lovable.”</p>

<p>Violet and Lucilla came in together at that
moment.</p>

<p>“I must have a look at my little niece,”
said the latter.</p>

<p>“And I at my granddaughter,” added
Violet.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, don’t say that,” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Elsie. “You are too young for it; isn’t she,
grandma?”</p>

<p>“She does look rather young to lay claim
to that appellation,” Grandma Elsie returned,
with an admiring smile up into her
daughter’s beautiful and youthful face.</p>

<p>“Ah, but her own grandsire being my husband
gives me something of a right in that
direction,” laughed Violet. “And anybody
might be glad to claim kinship with such a
darling,” she added, gazing down at the babe
as it lay on her mother’s knee.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Grandma Vi,” came in a
feeble little voice, apparently from the lips
of the babe.</p>

<p>At that moment the captain entered the
room.</p>

<p>“Ah, so my little granddaughter is on exhibition,
I see,” he said, as he approached the
little group gathered about Grandma Elsie
and the babe.</p>

<p>“Yes, grandpa,” she seemed to say. “My
papa helps me to talk.”</p>

<p>“Does he? I’m afraid you will lose your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ability to talk when he goes away,” said the
captain, bending down over the babe and gazing
with loving admiration into the wee face.
“She’s a fine child, I think, Max,” he said,
“one that I am proud to claim as my grandchild.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t seem to appreciate your
praise, my dear,” said Violet, as the child
began to squirm and cry.</p>

<p>At that the nurse came and took charge of
it, and its visitors vanished to other parts of
the house or the grounds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day was the Sabbath, and all who
were not needed in the sick room attended
church in the morning. In the afternoon,
according to their old custom, they assembled
together as a Bible class, the captain—as the
oldest—being the leader. The subject was
the New Jerusalem, its beauties, its delights,
and the character and bliss of its inhabitants.
“They will be very happy there,” said the captain.
“In Isaiah we read, ‘Behold, my servants
shall sing for joy of heart.... Behold,
I create new heavens and a new earth:
and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoice
in that which I create: for behold, I create
Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy.
And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in
my people: and the voice of weeping shall be
no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Mother, can you give us a text from the New
Testament teaching that there is no weeping
in heaven?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Grandma Elsie; “in the
twenty-first chapter and fourth verse of Revelation
we read: ‘And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes; and there shall be
no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
neither shall there be any more pain; for the
former things are passed away.’ It was sin,”
she said, “that brought sorrow, pain, sickness
and death into the world: there will be none
of any of them in the New Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“Will some one give us a Bible description
of the New Jerusalem?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“I will read it, father,” said Grace.
“‘And he carried me away in the spirit to a
great and high mountain, and shewed me that
great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending
out of heaven from God, having the glory of
God; and her light was like unto a stone most
precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as
crystal; and had a wall great and high, and
had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
angels, and names written thereon, which are
the names of the twelve tribes of the children
of Israel: On the east three gates; on the
north three gates; on the south three gates;
and on the west three gates. And the wall of
the city had twelve foundations, and in them
the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
And he that talked with me had a golden reed
to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and
the wall thereof. And the city lieth four
square, and the length is as large as the
breadth: and he measured the city with the
reed twelve thousand furlongs. The length
and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred
and forty and four cubits, according to
the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
And the building of the wall of it was of jasper:
and the city was pure gold, like unto
clear glass. And the foundations of the wall
of the city were garnished with all manner of
precious stones. The first foundation was
jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a
chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a
topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh,
a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And
the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every
several gate was of one pearl: and the street
of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent
glass. And I saw no temple therein:
for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are
the temple of it. And the city had no need
of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it:
for the glory of God did lighten it, and the
Lamb is the light thereof. And the nations
of them which are saved shall walk in the
light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring
their glory and honour into it. And the gates
of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
shall be no night there. And they shall bring
the glory and honour of the nations into it.
And there shall in no wise enter into it any
thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh
abomination, or maketh a lie: but they
which are written in the Lamb’s book of
life.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a beautiful, glorious city it will
be!” she exclaimed, when she had finished.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her father, “God grant we may
all be numbered among its citizens.”</p>

<p>“‘Looking for that blessed hope and the
glorious appearing of the great God and our
Saviour, Jesus Christ,’” quoted Mr. Leland.
“We may well look for it with joyful longing.
May the goodness and love of God lead
us all to repentance, make us all His devoted,
faithful servants.”</p>

<p>“And He will be the same Jesus who gave
His life for us,” said Grandma Elsie, in a
voice tremulous with emotion. “The angels
said to those who were gazing up after Him
as He was taken up into heaven and a cloud
received Him out of their sight, ‘Ye men of
Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
This same Jesus which is taken up from you
into heaven shall so come in like manner as
ye have seen Him go into heaven.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harold, “and we are told in
Thessalonians, the Lord Himself shall descend
from heaven; in Revelation, ‘Behold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall
see Him.’ And Matthew tells us, ‘The Son of
Man shall come in His glory, and all the holy
angels with Him.’”</p>

<p>“And we shall see Him, know Him and be
conformed to His image,” said Mrs. Travilla
in joyous tones. “‘It doth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we know that, when He
shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we
shall see Him as He is.’”</p>

<p>“What a delightful thought!” exclaimed
her daughter, Mrs. Leland. “Oh, it is strange
that we can ever be so taken up as we are with
worldly matters. Do you think, captain, that
His second coming is near?”</p>

<p>“There are many things which make that
seem probable,” replied Captain Raymond.
“Don’t you think that we should try to live
as if it might be any day—or indeed at any
moment?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” she answered; “especially
as death may take us into His presence at any
moment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” he answered; “and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
should all strive to live as when death comes
we shall wish we had. Live near to Him—to
His honor and glory—that whenever He
shall come we may be found ready. He tells
us, ‘Watch, therefore, for ye know not what
hour your Lord doth come.... Be ye also
ready: for in such an hour as ye think not
the Son of Man cometh.’ That warning word
‘watch’ is repeated again and again. ‘Watch,
therefore; for ye know neither the day nor
the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.’”</p>

<p>“‘Be ye also ready,’” repeated little Elsie
reflectively. “Papa, please tell us just how
to get ready—just what we must do.”</p>

<p>“Give ourselves to the Lord Jesus who
says, ‘Him that cometh unto me I will in no
wise cast out.’ ‘God so loved the world that
He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in Him should not perish, but
have everlasting life.’ ‘Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.’”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t everybody believe that it’s all true
about Him, papa?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It is not enough to believe simply that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Jesus lived in this world years ago, and died
the cruel death of crucifixion; we must believe
also that He was God as well as man; for
otherwise He could not save us; had He been
only a man His death would not have atoned
for the sins of the world—or of all in it who
have believed or will believe on Him. But the
Bible tells us these things as plainly as words
can speak. In the first chapter of John’s
Gospel we are told, ‘In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God. The same was in the beginning
with God. All things were made by
Him, and without Him was not anything
made that was made.’ And Jesus Himself
said, ‘I and my father are one.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Leland, “it is incomprehensible
to me how any one can profess to
believe the Bible to be the Word of God and
yet deny the divinity of Christ—so plainly
is that taught in it again and again.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days glided by very pleasantly to the
little company at Crag Cottage, the greater
part of them passed by the children in the
open air, far enough from the house to make
them feel sure of not disturbing Evelyn, even
if they indulged in rather loud chat and
laughter.</p>

<p>In the evening, if it were not too cool, they
usually gathered upon the porch overlooking
the river, and were very apt to be entertained
with a story from either Grandma Elsie or
Captain Raymond.</p>

<p>“I’m right glad to be where I can see this
grand old Hudson River,” remarked Edward
Leland one evening as they sat there. “It is
a beautiful stream, and so much happened on
it in early days.”</p>

<p>“What in particular are you thinking
of now?” asked his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Something I read not so very long ago in
Lossing’s Field Book of the Revolution. He
tells of things that happened to Putnam
nearly twenty years before that war. He was
lying in a bateau on the east side of the river
above the rapids, when he was suddenly surprised
by a party of Indians. He couldn’t
cross the river quickly enough to escape the
danger from their rifles; so the only way to
save himself from being killed or taken
prisoner—which I suppose would have
amounted to the same thing—was to go over
those dangerous rapids. It took Putnam but
an instant to decide; he steered directly down
the current, between whirling eddies and over
shelving rocks, cleared them all in a few moments,
and was gliding along the smooth current
below, far out of the reach of the Indians’
weapons. They would never have
dared to go over those falls as he did, so
thought he must have been favored by the
Great Spirit, and that if they should try to
kill him with powder and ball, that Great
Spirit would consider it an affront to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Putnam was certainly a very brave man,”
continued the lad; “Lossing tells of a brave
deed of his at Fort Edward. He says that in
the winter of 1756 the barracks took fire, and
the magazine, which contained three hundred
barrels of gunpowder, was only twelve feet
distant from the blaze. Men attempted to
knock down those barracks with heavy cannon,
but failed.</p>

<p>“Putnam, who was stationed on Roger’s
Island, in the Hudson, opposite the fort, must
have seen the fire. He hurried over there,
took his station on the roof of the barracks,
and ordered a line of soldiers to hand him
water. He did his best, but could not put the
fire out; it drew nearer and nearer to the
magazine. Colonel Haviland, seeing his danger,
ordered him down, but he was too brave
and persevering to obey that order; he worked
on and would not leave his post until the
building began to totter as if just ready to
fall. Then he jumped to the ground and put
himself between it—the falling barrack—and
the magazine, and poured on water with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
his might. The outside planks of the magazine
were already burned so that there was
only a thin partition between the fire and the
powder; but he did succeed in extinguishing
the flames and saving the powder.”</p>

<p>“But wasn’t he dreadfully burned?” asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>“Yes, his hands and face were,” replied
Edward, “and his whole body more or less
blistered; so that it was several weeks before
he recovered from the bad effects of that
fight.”</p>

<p>“He must have been a very brave man,”
cried Ned Raymond.</p>

<p>“He was,” said Grandma Elsie. “Would
you all like to hear something more about him
and his doings?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, grandma, if you will be
pleased to tell it,” answered several young
voices, and at once she began:</p>

<p>“He was a Massachusetts man; had a fine,
large farm, where he paid particular attention
to the raising of fruits and of sheep.
There had been a good many wild beasts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that region, but in 1735 all seemed to have
been killed except an old female wolf that
for some seasons went on visiting the farm yards
and killing the fowls. Her lair was
near Putnam’s farm, and one night she killed
sixty or seventy of his fine sheep. Of course,
a company was promptly raised to search
for and kill her. They tracked her to her
lair in a cave. It was dark and narrow, but
Putnam pursued her into it, shot her at short
range and dragged her out in triumph.</p>

<p>“Twenty years after that, 1755, troops were
raised to defend the country against the
French, and Putnam was given the rank of
captain. He became a leading member of
the band of Rangers that did much to annoy
and embarrass the enemy during the next two
years. In 1757 he was promoted to the rank
of major, and after that occurred the two
events Edward has just given us.</p>

<p>“In August, 1758, he was taken prisoner by
the Indians, after a sharp skirmish, near
Wood Creek. The Indians tortured him, and
then decided to burn him alive. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
stripped him, bound him to a tree and kindled
a fire about him. The flames were searing
his flesh when Captain Molang, a French
officer, came rushing through the crowd, scattered
the firebrands, cuffed and upbraided the
Indians, and released poor Putnam.”</p>

<p>“Then did he get away from the Indians?”
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“He was taken to Montreal and soon
afterward exchanged,” replied her grandma.
“Afterward he was promoted to a lieutenant-colonelcy
and given command of a regiment.</p>

<p>“The next year he was with General Amherst
in his march from Oswego to Montreal.
When going down the St. Lawrence River
they found it desirable to dislodge the French
from Fort Oswegatchie; but the approach to
it was guarded by two schooners, the larger
one having twelve guns, which could have
done serious damage to the English boats.
Thinking of that danger, General Amherst
said: ‘I wish there were some way of taking
that schooner.’ ‘All right,’ said Putnam;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
‘just give me some wedges and a mallet,
and half a dozen men of my own choosing,
and I’ll soon take her for you.’</p>

<p>“The British general smiled incredulously,
evidently not believing the thing could be
done; but he consented to Putnam’s making
the proposed attempt, and in the night Putnam
and his little party got into a light boat
and, with muffled oars, rode under the schooner’s
stern and drove the wedges between the
rudder and the stern-post so firmly as to render
the helm unmanageable. They then went
around under the bow, cut the vessel’s cable,
then rowed quietly away. All that, of course,
made the vessel unmanageable. She drifted
ashore before morning and struck her colors;
then the other French vessels surrendered
and the English captured the fort.</p>

<p>“But I shall not attempt to tell the story
of the services of Putnam’s whole life,” continued
Grandma Elsie. “I suppose what you
all care particularly to hear is of what he
did and suffered in and after the Revolution.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, grandma—yes, indeed!” replied several
voices, and she continued her story.</p>

<p>“In August, 1774, before General Gage
had quite shut up the approaches to Boston,
Putnam rode over the Neck with one hundred
sheep as a gift from the parish of Brooklyn.
While there he was the guest of Dr. Warren.
On the twentieth of the next April came the
news of the fight at Concord.”</p>

<p>“Ah! news didn’t fly so fast then as it
does now,” remarked Eric.</p>

<p>“No, not by any means,” assented his
grandma. “Putnam was in the field ploughing
when it reached him. So great was
his excitement on hearing it that he left his
plough in the furrow, and without waiting
to put on his uniform, mounted a horse and
rode toward Cambridge, reaching there at
sunrise of the next morning. Later in the
same day he was at Concord; but he was soon
summoned to Hartford to consult with the
Connecticut Legislature. He returned from
there with the chief command of the forces
of that colony, and the rank of brigadier.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was one of the officers at the battle of
Bunker Hill, wasn’t he, grandma?” asked
Eric.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is spoken of as the ranking officer,
and it was he who had the earthworks
thrown up on the crest of Bunker Hill in the
rear, and who, toward the close of the day,
conducted the retreat and directed the fortifying
of Prospect Hill.”</p>

<p>“And his rank was soon made still higher
by Congress, was it not, grandma?” asked
Edward.</p>

<p>“Yes; in June, 1775, Congress appointed
Washington to the chief command and made
Ward, Lee, Schuyler and Putnam major-generals.
Putnam was in command for a
time in New York, in Philadelphia and
Princeton; afterward he had charge of the
defence of the highlands of the Hudson River,
with headquarters at Peekskill.</p>

<p>“There took place an occurrence that will
no doubt interest you all. A man named
Edmund Palmer was caught lurking in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
American camp and condemned to death as a
spy.</p>

<p>“The British considered American spies
worthy of death, but that those in the king’s
service were not; so Sir Henry Clinton sent
up a flag of truce from New York and a
threat to Putnam of signal vengeance should
he dare to injure the person of the king’s
liege subject, Edmund Palmer.</p>

<p>“The old general’s reply was brief and to
the point. I think I can recall it word for
word:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<i>Headquarters</i>, 7th of August, 1777.</p>

<p>“‘Edmund Palmer, an officer in the enemy’s
service, was taken as a spy lurking
within our lines. He has been tried as a spy,
condemned as a spy, and shall be executed
as a spy, and the flag is ordered to depart
immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Israel Putnam</span>.</p>

<p>“‘P. S.—He has accordingly been executed.’”</p></div>

<p>“I daresay Sir Henry Clinton was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
angry when he read that note?” remarked
Eric.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his brother, “but no doubt it
was well for Putnam that Sir Henry never
had power to carry out his threat of vengeance
upon him.”</p>

<p>“Is that all of the story about him, grandma?”
asked Ned Raymond.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “except that there is a
story of a remarkable escape of his from
General Tryon’s troops by riding down a
flight of stone steps at Horseneck, or West
Greenwich, in the town of Greenwich, Conn.
He was visiting his outposts there, staying at
the house of General Mead. It was the 26th
of March, early in the morning, and he was
standing before a looking-glass shaving, when
he saw in the glass the reflection of a body of
red-coats marching up the road from the
westward. Though only half shaven, he
dropped his razor, buckled on his sword, and,
hurrying out, mounted his horse and hastened
to prepare his handful of men to oppose the
approaching enemy. There were nearly fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
hundred of the British regulars and Hessians,
under Governor Tryon. Putnam had
with him only one hundred and fifty men.
He arranged them upon the brow of the hill
near a church in the village. There he
planted a battery composed of two old iron
field-pieces, and waited for the coming of the
enemy.</p>

<p>“They came up in a solid column, until almost
within musket shot; then detachments
were broken off and tried to gain the Americans’
flanks. At the same time the British
dragoons and some infantry made ready to
charge. Perceiving that and noting the overwhelming
numbers of the enemy, Putnam
ordered a retreat—after some volleys of musketry
and a few discharges of the field-pieces.
But the enemy was so near that the retreat
of the Americans became a rout. The soldiers
broke and fled singly to the adjacent
swamps, and the general, putting spurs to his
horse, hastened toward Stamford, pursued
by several of the dragoons.</p>

<p>“About a quarter of a mile distant from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Putnam’s starting on that ride is a steep declivity;
on the brow of that the road turned
northward, and passed, in a broad sweep,
round the hill. Putnam, seeing that his pursuers
were gaining on him, took a desperate
resolve, left the road, and wheeled his horse,
while on a gallop, down the rocky height,
making a zigzag course to the bottom, and
reaching the road again in safety.”</p>

<p>“And did the dragoons follow him, grandma?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No,” she said; “it was too perilous for
them. They did not dare attempt it. They
fired their pistols at Putnam, but did not
succeed in wounding him. He rode on in
safety to Stamford.”</p>

<p>“Was Putnam good to his soldiers, grandma?”
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“I think he was,” Mrs. Travilla answered;
“he felt for them in their sore privations and
tried to get them help. Lossing tells us
that in a letter to Washington, January,
1778, he gives a picture of the terrible suffering
his soldiers in the highlands were enduring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
He said: ‘Very few have either a
shoe or a shirt, and most of them have neither
stockings, breeches, nor overalls. Several
companies of enlisted artificers are in the
same situation, and unable to work in the
field.’ Lossing tells us of something similar
that occurred at Reading, in Connecticut, the
next year—in 1779. The troops, poor fellows,
were badly fed and clothed and worse
paid, for their small pittance when it came
was in the form of Continental money, which
was depreciating rapidly. Brooding over
their hard lot, and talking the matter over
among themselves, they resolved to march to
Hartford and demand of the assembly there
a redress of their grievances. The second
brigade had assembled under arms with that
intention, when Putnam learned what was
going on. He at once galloped to the encampment,
and earnestly addressed them:</p>

<p>“‘My brave lads, where are you going?’
he asked. ‘Do you intend to desert your officers,
and to invite the enemy to follow you
into the country? Whose cause have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
been fighting and suffering so long for? Is it
not your own? Have you no property, no
parents, wives, or children? You have behaved
like men so far; all the world is full of
your praise, and posterity will stand astonished
at your deeds, but not if you spoil all
at last. Don’t you consider how much the
country is distressed by the war, and that
your officers have not been better paid than
yourselves? But we all expect better times
and that the country will do us ample justice.
Let us all stand by one another, then, and
fight it out like brave soldiers. Think what
a shame it would be for Connecticut men to
run away from their officers.’ That was Putnam’s
little speech, and when he had finished
the discontented regiments cheered him
loudly, then returned to their quarters in good
humor, resolved still to suffer and fight for
the cause of their country.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellows!” sighed Elsie.</p>

<p>“Did Putnam live till the Revolutionary
War was over, grandma?” asked Eric.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied; “he died on the 29th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of May, 1790, aged seventy-two years. There
is an inscription on the marble slab over his
grave which says that he was ever tenderly
attentive to the lives and happiness of his
men and that he dared to lead where any
dared to follow. It speaks of how much the
country owes to his disinterested and gallant
exertions. It speaks of his generosity as singular,
his honesty as proverbial, and says that
he was one who, with small advantages, slender
education, and no powerful friends,
raised himself to universal esteem, and to
offices of eminent distinction by personal
worth and the diligent services of a useful
life.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Thank</span> you for telling us about Putnam,
grandma,” said Elsie. “I think he was an
American to be proud of. Now if you are
not too tired, won’t you tell us the story of
Jane McCrea? I know a little of it, and
would like to know more.”</p>

<p>“I am very willing to tell you the little I
know about her,” replied Mrs. Travilla, in
her kindly, pleasant tones. “She was the
daughter of a Scotch Presbyterian minister,
of Jersey City, opposite New York. In that
city—New York—lived a family of the name
of Campbell. A daughter of theirs and Jennie
had become very intimate. Mr. Campbell
died at sea and his widow married a Mr.
McNeil. He, too, was lost at sea, and she
removed with her family to an estate owned
by him at Fort Edward. Jane had a brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
living near there. Mr. McCrea, the father,
was a widower, and when he died she went to
live with her brother, and, being so near the
McNeils, the intimacy was renewed and she
spent much of her time in Mrs. McNeil’s
house. Mrs. Jones, a widow with six sons,
lived near the McCreas, and one of them,
named David, became Jennie’s lover. When
the war broke out he and his brothers became
Tories, and in the autumn of 1776 David and
his brother, Jonathan, went to Canada, and
when Burgoyne collected his forces at St.
Johns, at the foot of Lake Champlain, David
and Jonathan Jones were among them.
Jonathan was made captain and David a lieutenant
in the division under General Fraser,
and at the time we are speaking of they were
with the British army near Sandy Hill.
Jennie’s brother was a Whig, and prepared to
remove to Albany; but Mrs. McNeil was a
staunch Loyalist, a cousin of General Fraser,
and intended to remain at Fort Edward.
Jennie was at Mrs. McNeil’s, and lingered
there even after it was known that the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
were near, and her brother had sent her repeatedly
urgent requests to join him where
he was—five miles farther down the river,
and be ready to flee when necessity should
compel. But she lingered, probably with the
faint hope of seeing her lover again. At last
her brother sent a peremptory order for her
to join him, and she promised to go down to
the spot where he was in a large bateau, which
was expected to leave with several families
the next day.</p>

<p>“But Jennie had waited too long. Early
the next morning a black servant boy belonging
to Mrs. McNeil espied some Indians
stealthily approaching the house, and, giving
the alarm, he fled to the fort, about eight rods
distant.</p>

<p>“Jennie’s young friend, Mrs. McNeil’s
daughter, was away from home at the time,
and the family there just then consisted of
only Mrs. McNeil, Jennie, two small children
and a black female servant.</p>

<p>“The kitchen stood a few feet from the
house, and when the alarm was given the colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
woman snatched up the children, fled
with them to the kitchen, and from there,
through a trap-door, into the cellar.</p>

<p>“Mrs. McNeil and Jennie followed. Jennie,
young and able to move briskly, reached
the trap-door first; but Mrs. McNeil, being
old and corpulent, could not move rapidly,
and before she could get down into the cellar
the Indians were in the house, and a powerful
savage seized her by the hair and dragged her
up. Another went into the cellar and brought
out Jennie, but the darkness of the cellar
favored the colored woman and the children.
It would seem the Indians did not see them,
so left them in their hiding place unharmed.</p>

<p>“The Indians started off on the road to
Sandy Hill, taking Mrs. McNeil and Jennie
with them; that was the road to Burgoyne’s
camp.</p>

<p>“When they came to the foot of a hill,
where the road forked, they caught two horses
that were grazing, and tried to mount their
prisoners upon them. Mrs. McNeil was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
heavy to be lifted on the horse easily, so told
the Indians by signs that she could not ride.
Then two stout ones of them took her by the
arms and hurried her up the road over the
hill, while the others, with Jennie on the
horse, went along the road running west of
a tree.</p>

<p>“The negro boy who ran to the fort gave the
alarm, and a small detachment was immediately
sent out for the rescue of the captured
ones. They fired several volleys at the Indians
without hitting them. Lossing, whose
version of the sad story I am giving you, goes
on to tell that Mrs. McNeil said that the Indians
who were hurrying her up the hill
seemed to watch the flash of the guns, and
several times threw her upon her face, at the
same time falling down themselves, and she
distinctly heard the balls whistle above them.
The firing ceased when they had got to the
second hill from the village. They stopped
there and stripped her of all her garments
except her chemise; then they led her, in that
plight, into the British camp. Her cousin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
General Fraser, was there, and she reproached
him bitterly for sending his ‘scoundrel
Indians’ after her. He said he did not
know of her being away from New York City,
and he took every pains to make her comfortable.
She was so large that not a woman
in the camp had a gown big enough for her,
so Fraser lent her his camp coat for a garment,
and a pocket handkerchief to take the
place of her stolen cap.</p>

<p>“Very soon after she was taken into the
camp, two parties of Indians came in with
fresh scalps, one of which Mrs. McNeil at
once recognized by the long glossy hair as
that of Jennie McCrea. She was horror
struck and boldly charged them with the murder
of the poor girl. They, however, stoutly
denied it. They said that while hurrying her
along the road, on horseback, near the spring
west of the pine-tree, a bullet intended for
them from one of the American guns mortally
wounded the poor girl, and she fell from the
horse. They had lost a prisoner for whom
they had expected a reward, and the next best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
thing was to take her scalp and bear it in
triumph to the camp and get the promised
reward for such trophies.</p>

<p>“Mrs. McNeil always believed their story
to be true, as she knew they had been fired
upon by the detachment from the fort, and
that it was far more to their interest to take a
prisoner to the British camp than a scalp, as
they would get the larger price for the former.
Burgoyne had told the Indians they should
be paid for prisoners whom they took, but
called to account for scalps.”</p>

<p>“So it seems Burgoyne wasn’t all bad,”
commented Eric. “And I think it must have
been a good deal more trouble to get that
big fat old woman into the camp alive than
it would have been to get the young girl there
without killing her.”</p>

<p>“Was her lover there in that camp, grandma?”
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“No; Lieutenant Jones was not there, but
it was known that she was betrothed to him,
and the story got about that he had sent the
Indians for her, that they quarrelled on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
way concerning the reward he had offered,
and murdered her to settle the dispute.</p>

<p>“The story grew in horror as it passed from
one to another, and produced a deep and widespread
indignation, increased by a published
letter from Gates to Burgoyne charging him
with allowing the Indians to butcher with
impunity defenceless women and children.</p>

<p>“Burgoyne denied it, declaring that the
case of Jane McCrea was the only one act of
Indian cruelty he had heard of. That assertion
is hard to believe, for the savages murdered
a whole family—a man, his wife, three
children, a sister-in-law and three negroes,
near Fort Edward on the same day that Jennie
lost her life. And they were Tories; but,
afraid of the savages, were getting ready to
flee to Albany. On that fatal morning a
younger daughter of Mr. Gilmer went to help
Mrs. Allen with her preparations to move,
and, staying longer than had been expected,
her father sent a negro boy down for her.
He soon came back screaming, ‘They are all
dead—father, mother, young missus and all.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
And it was too true. That morning, while
they were at breakfast, the Indians had burst
in upon them and killed every one.”</p>

<p>“And what did the Gilmers do about it,
grandma?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Hurried away to Fort Edward, going
very cautiously for fear of meeting Indians.
And they did see some of the party who had
plundered Mrs. McNeil’s house in the morning.
They had emptied the straw from the
beds and filled the ticks with various things
which they had stolen. And Mrs. McNeil’s
daughter, who was with the Gilmers, saw her
mother’s looking-glass tied upon the back of
one of the Indians.”</p>

<p>“And did those folks get safely to Fort
Edward, grandma?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“They did,” replied Mrs. Travilla, then
went on with her story. “The story of Jennie
McCrea’s massacre became known all over
the civilized part of this land and in Europe.
Burke, says Lossing, used it with powerful
effect in the British House of Commons.
Burgoyne summoned the Indians to council,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and demanded the surrender of the one who
bore off the scalp of Jennie McCrea, to be
punished as a murderer; but from policy he
pardoned him, lest the Indians should be so
offended if he punished him that they would
cease to help the British in their efforts to
conquer the Americans.</p>

<p>“It had been said that Lieutenant Jones
had sent his Jennie a letter by the Indians,
and them as an escort to take her to the
British camp. But he denied it all, and indeed
he had no need to send for her, as the
Americans were retreating, leaving only a
small guard at Fort Edward, and in a day or
two the British would have full possession of
the fort, so that he and his Jennie might have
had a safe personal interview.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything more known about
Lieutenant Jones, grandma?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“Lossing tells us that he had an interview
with some connections of his family, and
learned from them that he lived in Canada,
to be an old man, and died there. The death
of his Jennie was a dreadful blow to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and he never recovered from it. He had been
gay and very talkative when quite young, but
after that sad event he was melancholy and
taciturn. He never married, and went into
society as little as he could without neglecting
business. Every year he kept the anniversary
of Jennie’s death—he would shut
himself in his room and refuse to see any
one. His friends felt for him and were careful
not to speak of the Revolution in his
presence. He bought Jennie’s scalp and kept
it as a cherished possession.”</p>

<p>“Grandma, was Jennie buried? And if
so, is it known where?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“Yes; Lossing tells that a picket-guard of
one hundred men, under Lieutenant Van
Vechten, was stationed on the hill a little
north of the pine-tree on that day that we
have been talking about, and at the moment
when the house of Mrs. McNeil was attacked
and plundered, and she and Jennie were carried
off, other parties of Indians, belonging
to the same expedition, came rushing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the woods from different points and fell upon
the Americans. Several were killed and their
scalps borne off. The party that went out
from the fort in pursuit found their bodies.
Jennie and the officer were found lying near
together, close by the spring, and only a few
feet from the pine-tree. They were stripped
of clothing. They were carried immediately
to the fort—the Americans at once evacuated
it—and the body of Jennie was sent down the
river in the bateau in which she was to have
gone to her brother. It seems that he was
very fond of her, and took charge of her
mutilated corpse with the deepest grief. It
was buried at the same time and place with
that of the lieutenant, on the west bank of
the Hudson, near the mouth of a small creek
about three miles below Fort Edward.”</p>

<p>“Did the Indians kill Mrs. McNeil, grandma?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No; she lived a good many years, and her
grave can be seen in the village cemetery near
the ruins of the fort. Lossing says that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the summer of 1826 the remains of Jennie
were taken up and put in the same grave with
her. A plain white marble slab, with only
the name Jane McCrea on it, marks the
spot.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children’s bedtime had come and they
had gone to their sleeping quarters for the
night. Grandma Elsie was holding the new
baby while having a bit of chat with its
mother; most of the other grown people were
enjoying themselves together in the parlor,
but Lucilla and her father were pacing the
front porch, as they so often did, while Mamma
Vi put the younger ones to bed.</p>

<p>“Have you had a pleasant time to-day,
daughter?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” she replied. “I paid Eva
a visit and enjoyed holding and looking at
the darling little newcomer—Baby Mary. I
like the name; don’t you, father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, both the name and the one who bears
it. What else have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Sitting out here with a bit of needlework
while Grandma Elsie gave us some interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
passages from the history of our country
in Revolutionary days—of Putnam and his
services, and the sad story of poor Jane
McCrea. I have been thinking, father, that
you could give us interesting facts concerning
other actors in the thrilling scenes and experiences
of those dark days for our country.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” he answered, “though I
doubt if I should equal mother as a narrator.”</p>

<p>“A doubt I don’t in the least share, father,”
laughed Lucilla. “You always speak the
truth, but are a good story teller for all that.”</p>

<p>“That is in the judgment of my very partial
daughter,” the captain responded, with
an amused look and smile. “There are other
Revolutionary heroes,” he continued, “the
facts concerning whom would make very interesting
tales—Morgan and Schuyler, for
instance.”</p>

<p>“And you will tell them to us, father? Oh,
that will be fine.”</p>

<p>“And I shall be glad indeed if I can add
to the information and enjoyment of my own
young people and the others,” he returned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
“Evelyn has quite a library here, collected
by her father, in which are a number of encyclopædias
and historical works—those of
Lossing and others. I shall refresh my memory
in regard to Morgan and Schuyler, and
perhaps tell you something of one or both
to-morrow evening, should mother feel indisposed
for such work.”</p>

<p>It was settled at the tea table the next day
that the captain was to be the narrator for
the little company for that evening, Grandma
Elsie saying she would greatly prefer being
a listener. All gathered about him on the
front porch directly upon leaving the table,
and he began the story at once.</p>

<p>“Daniel Morgan was born in New Jersey
about 1737. There is little or nothing known
of his parents except that he had a pious
mother and that he was of Welsh extraction.
When about seventeen years old he went to
Virginia, where he worked as a farmer for
some years. Early in 1754 he removed to
Charlestown, Va., and the next year he
began his military career, going with Braddock’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
army in the expedition against Fort
du Quesne.</p>

<p>“He seems to have been a teamster, and in
the rout did good service in bringing away
the wounded after the defeat. Washington,
you will remember, was there as aid-de-camp
to Braddock, and doubtless he and Morgan
became acquainted then.</p>

<p>“It is said that Morgan was unjustly punished
with five hundred lashes for knocking
down a British officer who struck him with
the flat of his sword.</p>

<p>“Afterward he was attached to the quartermaster’s
department, and his duty was to
haul supplies to the military posts along the
frontier.</p>

<p>“About that time, at the head of a few
backwoodsmen, he defeated a small force of
Frenchmen and Indians, and received from
Governor Dinwiddie an ensign’s commission.</p>

<p>“Afterward, while on his way to Winchester
with despatches, he and others engaged in
a fierce woodland fight with the Indians, in
which nearly all Morgan’s companions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
killed and he was severely wounded, being
shot through the neck with a musket ball. At
the moment he supposed the wound to be
fatal—he was almost fainting—but resolved
not to leave his scalp in the hands of the Indians.
He fell forward with his arms tightly
clasped about the neck of his horse, and
though mists were gathering before his eyes,
he spurred away through the forest paths,
until his foremost Indian pursuer, finding it
impossible to come up with him, hurled his
tomahawk after him with a yell of baffled rage
and gave up the chase. That was the only
wound he ever received.”</p>

<p>“And it didn’t hinder him from doing
great service to his country in the Revolutionary
War,” remarked Eric Leland.</p>

<p>“Some few years later,” continued the
captain, “Morgan obtained a grant of land,
took to farming and stock-raising, and married
a farmer’s daughter, Abigail Bailey, who
is said to have been a woman of rare beauty
and lofty character. He named his home the
‘Soldier’s Rest,’ but was soon called away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
from it by Pontiac’s war. In that he served
as a lieutenant. He prospered with his farming
and acquired considerable property. But
the calls to war were frequent. In 1771 he
was commissioned captain of the militia of
Frederick County, and two years later he
served in Lord Dunmore’s war on the frontier.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">In</span> June, 1775, Congress called for ten
companies of riflemen from Pennsylvania,
Virginia and Maryland to join the Continental
army besieging Boston,” continued the
captain. “Morgan was chosen captain of one
of the Virginia companies, consisting of
ninety-six men, and with it he reached Cambridge
about the middle of July.</p>

<p>“A month later eleven hundred hardy men
were detached from the army for the service
of Arnold in his expedition against Canada,
and its riflemen were commanded by Captain
Daniel Morgan. We will not now go over the
story of that toilsome, perilous and unfortunate
expedition. The journey through the
wilderness was a terrible one; but our brave
men persevered and reached Canada. Morgan
and his men were the first to cross the St.
Lawrence and reconnoitre the approaches to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Quebec, which was too strongly defended to
be attacked with any hope of success. But a
great attack was made on New Year’s morning,
1776, in which Montgomery was killed
and Arnold disabled. Morgan stormed the
battery opposed to him, but not being supported,
he and his detachment were surrounded
and taken prisoners. But General
Carleton, admiring Morgan for his bravery,
released him on parole and he went home to
Virginia.</p>

<p>“Washington earnestly recommended him
to Congress as worthy of promotion, and in
November they gave him a colonel’s commission.
He was duly exchanged and released
from parole. He raised a regiment of riflemen
and joined the army at Morristown,
New Jersey, late in March.</p>

<p>“Morgan’s services in reconnoitring were
very great in the skilful campaign of the following
June, in which Washington prevented
Howe from crossing New Jersey.</p>

<p>“In the following July Burgoyne’s descent
into northern New York made it desirable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
concentrate as large a body of troops there as
possible to oppose him, and on the 16th of
August Morgan was sent with his regiment
to join the army near Stillwater, of which
Gates had lately taken command. His force
was five hundred picked riflemen, of whom
Washington said that he expected the most
eminent service from them; nor was he disappointed.
And it is said that when Burgoyne
was introduced to Morgan after the battle of
Saratoga, he seized him by the hand and exclaimed:
‘My dear sir, you command the finest
regiment in the world!’ It was no wonder
that Burgoyne thought highly of their skill;
for Morgan and his men had played a principal
part in the bloody battle of Freeman’s
farm, in which Arnold frustrated Burgoyne’s
attempt to dislodge the American left wing
from Bemis Heights, and their services were
quite as great in the final conflict of October
7th, in which the British army was wrecked.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it in the battle of Bemis Heights
that General Fraser was killed, papa?” asked
Elsie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her father. “Morgan’s men
were skilful riflemen and one of them shot
Fraser. Morgan, seeing that by directing
and cheering on the British troops Fraser was
doing more than any one else to defeat and
slay the Americans, perceived that much of
the fate of the battle rested upon him, and
that to bring victory to the Americans, who
were fighting for freedom, it was necessary
that Fraser should be taken away. So, calling
a file of his best men around him, he
pointed toward the British right and said:
‘That gallant officer is General Fraser. I
admire and honor him, but it is necessary that
he should die; victory for the enemy depends
upon him. Take your station in that clump
of bushes and do your duty.’</p>

<p>“Lossing says, ‘Within five minutes Fraser
fell mortally wounded, and was carried to the
camp by two grenadiers. Shortly before that
two rifle balls had struck very near him, one
cutting the crupper of his horse, and the other
passing through his mane, a little back of his
ears. Seeing all that, Fraser’s aid begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
him to retire from that place. But Fraser
replied, ‘My duty forbids me to fly from danger,’
and the next moment came the shot that
killed him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, it was a sad, sad thing to do; a
sad thing to order!” exclaimed Elsie. “I
don’t see how Morgan could do it.”</p>

<p>“It was a sad thing. War is always dreadful
and a great and fearful wrong—often on
both sides, sometimes right on one, as I think
it was in our War of the Revolution; very
wicked on the side of King George and his
ministers, right and praiseworthy on the
part of the Americans who were fighting for
freedom for themselves and their posterity.
I cannot see why it should be thought any
more sinful to kill Fraser than any one of the
privates under him and whom he was ordering
to shoot our men; and no doubt his death
at that time saved many—probably hundreds
of the lives of Americans who were fighting
for life, liberty, home, wives and children.</p>

<p>“And the mortal wounding of Fraser had
a good effect—a panic spread along the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
line. Burgoyne, who now took the command,
could not keep up the sinking courage
of his men. The whole line gave way and
fled hastily to their camp.</p>

<p>“But I shall not go farther into the account
of that battle at present; in the one
which followed on the 7th of October, and in
which the British army was wrecked, Morgan’s
services were equally great and important.</p>

<p>“After the victory Gates was unwilling to
send Morgan and his regiment back to Washington
at Whitemarsh, and it was only with
some difficulty and by sending Colonel Hamilton
with a special message that the sorely
tried commander-in-chief succeeded in obtaining
him.</p>

<p>“Washington was at Whitemarsh, near
Philadelphia, and on the 18th of November,
1777, Morgan joined him there; in time to
take part in the fight early in December of
that year.</p>

<p>“On Sunday, the 8th, they advanced, and
flanking parties were warmly attacked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Colonel Morgan and his rifle corps, and
Colonel Gist, with the Maryland militia.
The battle was quite severe. Twenty-seven
men in Morgan’s corps were killed and
wounded, beside Major Morris, a brave and
gallant officer, who was badly maimed. Sixteen
or seventeen of the Maryland militia
were wounded.</p>

<p>“The enemy’s loss, too, was considerable.
The movements of the British seemed to indicate
an intention to immediately attack the
Americans, so that Washington was presently
surprised to perceive that instead of advancing
they were marching precipitately, in two
divisions, toward Philadelphia. As their
adjutant remarked to Mrs. Lydia Darrah,
whose story you have all heard before, they
had been on a fool’s errand and accomplished
nothing.</p>

<p>“On the 25th of August, 1777, Washington,
with several divisions of his troops, Morgan
and his rifle corps among them, left
Philadelphia and encamped at Red Clay
Creek, a few miles below Wilmington, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
next day. Washington established his headquarters
at Wilmington, and at once made
preparations to oppose the march of the
enemy, scouts having brought him news of
their arrival at the head of Elk.</p>

<p>“In September, Washington broke up his
camp and crossed the Brandywine at Chadd’s
Ford, at about two o’clock on the morning of
the 9th. The 11th of September was the day
of the battle of Brandywine.”</p>

<p>“Which was a defeat for us, wasn’t it,
uncle?” asked Eric.</p>

<p>“Yes, though our troops fought very bravely,”
replied Captain Raymond. “There were
but eleven thousand of them and the British
force was probably not less than seventeen
thousand men. Lossing tells us that had
not conflicting intelligence perplexed and
thwarted him in his plans, it is probable that
victory would have attended Washington and
the American army. He was not dispirited.</p>

<p>“But to go back to Morgan. When in June,
1778, Sir Henry Clinton evacuated Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and set out for New York by way of
New Jersey, the news presently reached
Washington, and he at once broke up his
encampment at Valley Forge, and with almost
his whole army started in pursuit.</p>

<p>“Morgan was in that army with six hundred
men. This was on June 20. I will not
go over the whole story. The battle of Monmouth
was not fought until the next Sunday,
which was the 28th, and an exceedingly hot
day. I shall not go into the particulars in
regard to it just now, but only remark that
Morgan was most unaccountably kept out of
the conflict—he and his brave riflemen at a
distance from the field. For hours he was at
Richmond Mills, three miles from Monmouth
Court House, awaiting orders in an agony of
desire to engage in the battle, for he was within
sound of its fearful tumult. He strode
to and fro, uncertain what course to pursue,
and, like a hound on the leash, panting to be
away to action. It is not known why he was
not permitted to take part in that conflict. It
seems altogether likely that had he fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
upon the British rear with his fresh troops
at the close of the day, Sir Henry Clinton
and his army might have shared the fate of
Burgoyne and his at Saratoga.</p>

<p>“After the battle, Morgan joined in the
pursuit of the enemy and took many prisoners.</p>

<p>“About a year later, finding his health seriously
impaired, and, like many other officers,
feeling much dissatisfaction with the doings
of Congress, especially with regard to promotion,
Morgan sent in his resignation and
went home to Winchester.</p>

<p>“About a year after that, when Gates took
command of the southern army, Morgan was
urged to return to the service; but he refused
to serve as a colonel, because if he did he
would be outranked by so many commanders
of state militia that his movements would be
seriously hampered and his usefulness impaired.
As Congress declined to promote
him, he remained at home; but after the great
disaster at Camden he declared that it was
no time to let personal considerations have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
any weight, and he promptly joined Gates at
Hillsborough.</p>

<p>“That was in September; in October he
received promotion, being made a brigadier-general,
and Congress soon had reason to rejoice
over the fact that it had done that act
of justice, since it had resulted in placing
Morgan where his great powers could be made
of the uttermost service to the country.</p>

<p>“It was in December that Greene took
command of the southern army, and he then
sent Morgan, with nine hundred men, to
threaten the important inland posts of Augusta
and Ninety-six, and to co-operate with
the mountain militia. In order to protect
those posts and his communication with them,
Cornwallis sent the redoubtable Tarleton
with eleven hundred men to dispose of Morgan.
As they drew near, Morgan retreated
to the grazing ground known as the Cowpens,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
where, on a long rising slope, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
awaited Tarleton’s attack. His men were
drawn up in two lines, the militia, under
Pickens, in front, and the Continentals, under
Howard, one hundred and fifty yards behind.
Some distance behind these waited Colonel
William Washington, with his admirable
cavalry.</p>

<p>“When the British attacked Pickens’ line,
after a brief resistance, the militia broke into
two parts and retired behind Howard’s line of
Continentals. As the British advanced to
attack this line it retreated slowly, so as to
give Pickens time to reform his militia.
Presently Pickens swept forward in a great
semicircle around Howard’s right, and attacked
the British in their left flank. At the
same moment Colonel Washington swept
around Howard’s left and charged upon the
enemy’s right flank while Howard’s
line, after a few deadly volleys at thirty
yards, rushed forward with levelled bayonets.</p>

<p>“Thus terribly entrapped, most of the
British threw down their arms and surrendered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
while the rest scattered and fled. They
lost heavily, in killed, wounded and prisoners,
besides two field-pieces and one thousand
stand of arms. Only two hundred and seventy
escaped, among them Tarleton, who
barely saved himself in a furious single combat
with Colonel Washington.</p>

<p>“The loss of the Americans in this astonishing
action was twelve killed and sixty-one
wounded. It is said that in point of tactics
it was the most brilliant battle of the Revolutionary
War. And it is brilliant even compared
with the work of the greatest masters
of the military art.</p>

<p>“That victory of the Americans was a crippling
blow to Cornwallis, because it deprived
him of his most effective light infantry.</p>

<p>“Cornwallis was nearer than Morgan to the
fords of the Catawba which Morgan must
cross to rejoin Greene, but by a superb march
Morgan gained the river first, crossed it and
kept on into North Carolina.</p>

<p>“There was a masterly series of movements
there, after Greene’s arrival, which ended in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the battle of Guilford and Cornwallis’s retreat
into Virginia.</p>

<p>“But before the campaign was ended Morgan
was suffering so severely with rheumatism
that he was compelled to quit active work
and go home.</p>

<p>“That was in February, 1781. By the following
June he had so far recovered that he
was able to command troops to suppress a
Loyalist insurrection in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>

<p>“He then reported to Lafayette at his headquarters
near Jamestown, and was put in
command of all the light troops and cavalry
in the marquis’s army. But in August a return
of his rheumatism again obliged him to
go home.</p>

<p>“For the next thirteen years he had a quiet
life upon his estate. He grew wealthy, and
entertained many eminent and interesting
guests. His native qualities of mind were
such as to make his conversation instructive
and charming, in spite of the defect of his
early education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“In 1795, with the rank of major-general,
he held a command in the large army that, by
its mere presence in Western Pennsylvania,
put an end to the whiskey insurrection. The
next year he was elected by the Federalists to
Congress. But failing health again called
him home before the end of his term, and
from this time until his death he seldom left
his fireside. He died on the 6th of July,
1802, in the sixty-seventh year of his age.”</p>

<p>“Was he a Christian man, papa?” asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>“I think he was,” her father said in reply.
“He had a pious mother and it seems never
forgot her teachings. In his later years he
became a member of the Presbyterian church
in Winchester. ‘Ah,’ he would often exclaim,
when talking of the past, ‘people said old
Morgan never feared—they thought old Morgan
never prayed—they did not know old
Morgan was miserably afraid.’ He said he
trembled at Quebec, and in the gloom of early
morning, when approaching the battery at
Cape Diamond, he knelt in the snow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
prayed; and before the battle at the Cowpens,
he went into the woods, ascended a tree, and
there poured out his soul in prayer for protection.</p>

<p>“Morgan was large and strong. He was
six feet in height and very muscular, and
weighed more than two hundred pounds. His
strength and endurance were remarkable;
and he was a very handsome man—said to be
equalled by but few men of his time in beauty
of feature and expression. His manners
were quiet and refined, his bearing was noble
and his temper sweet, though his wrath was
easily aroused by the sight of injustice.”</p>

<p>“No wonder, then, that he took up arms
against King George,” remarked Lucilla.</p>

<p>“A natural result of having such a disposition,
I think,” returned her father, and
went on with his story.</p>

<p>“Morgan was noted for truthfulness and
candor, and throughout life his conduct was
regulated by the most rigid code of honor.
He was also, as I have said, a devout Christian.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad of that!” exclaimed little
Elsie; “and I hope we will all meet him in
heaven—the dear, brave, good man.”</p>

<p>“I hope we will, daughter,” responded the
captain heartily, while several of his other
listeners looked as if they shared the feelings
of love and admiration for the brave patriot,
Daniel Morgan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now a little past the children’s bedtime,
so they bade good-night, and went within
doors. Grace and Harold and Mr. Leland
withdrew from the porch also, and the captain
and Lucilla had it to themselves. They
paced back and forth, arm in arm, conversing
in rather subdued tones.</p>

<p>“You heard from Chester to-day?” he said
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; such a bright, cheerful letter.
He is very well, prospering with his business,
and enjoying himself morning and evenings
at Ion, where they are most kindly insistent
on entertaining him until my return. He
has been out to Sunnyside and reports that
everything is in fine order there—indoors
and out. He says he will be delighted to
see his wife when she returns, but hopes she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
will stay in the north until the weather is
cooler.”</p>

<p>“That is all very satisfactory,” said her
father. “I am glad you have so kind and
affectionate a husband, and I hope to be able
to return you to him in a very few weeks.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that, since the return will
not separate me, to any great extent, from the
dear father who does so much to make my life
bright and happy,” she said, with a sweet and
loving smile up into his face. “Oh, father,
how much easier and happier life seems to
be to us than it was to those poor fellows who
fought the battles of the Revolution through
such poverty and suffering. It makes my
heart ache to read and to think of the bleeding
of their bare feet on the snow as they marched
over it, and to know that they were in rags
and sometimes had little or nothing to eat.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her father, “I feel very much
as you do about it. I wish I knew they were
all Christians, therefore happy in heaven
now.”</p>

<p>“So do I, father,” she sighed, “but it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to me one of the very dreadful things about
war is its sending so many to death with no
time for preparation, and probably in the
heat of passion with their foes.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” he said. “War is a dreadful
thing; always very wicked on one side, if
not on both. The Revolutionary War was
right and commendable on the side of our
forbears—resisting tyranny as they were—and
we, their descendants, are reaping from
it the rich fruit of freedom.”</p>

<p>“And it is rich fruit!” exclaimed Lucilla
in joyous tones.</p>

<p>“Sounds quite like Fourth of July, sis,”
laughed a manly voice behind her, and turning
she found Max standing there.</p>

<p>“Will three be as good company as two?”
he asked, in the same lively tone in which he
had spoken before.</p>

<p>“Better,” replied their father; “at least in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
this instance; and the porch is wide enough
for three to walk abreast.”</p>

<p>“And it won’t hurt Lu to take one of my
arms as well as yours, sir,” said Max, offering
it.</p>

<p>“Well, I will; it isn’t every day now that
I get the chance,” she responded, slipping her
hand into it. “Now I think we will have a
fine promenade.”</p>

<p>“What report can you give of wife and
daughter at the present moment, Max?”
asked the captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, they are doing finely. Eva says she
feels quite well enough to be up and about if
that tyrannical doctor didn’t forbid it. And
our baby is good as gold—and a great deal
more valuable,” he added, with a happy
laugh.</p>

<p>“She’s prettier than gold this one of her
aunts thinks,” laughed Lucilla. “And what a
treasure she will be in Sunnyside, our sweet,
pretty home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope so. It is very good of you to
give her such a royal welcome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, if only her father could be with us
all the time!” sighed Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Perhaps in that case his companionship
might, at times, grow wearisome,” laughed
Max. “‘Blessings brighten as they take
their flight,’ and perhaps it may be so with
brothers and husbands.”</p>

<p>“A remark I should advise you not to make
in Eva’s hearing,” she returned in mirthful
tones.</p>

<p>“Ah, she would know just how to appreciate
it,” said Max. Then, turning to their
father, “I was much interested in your account
of Morgan, sir,” he said. “He was a
grand man and did a great deal to win the
independence of these United States, now the
greatest, grandest country the sun shines
upon.”</p>

<p>“He did, indeed,” the captain said emphatically,
“and deserves to be remembered
with love and gratitude. He was a very successful
leader in those times of our country’s
sore distress; and he could not have been had
not God given him wisdom and skill in answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to prayer. My son, I hope you will follow his
example in that.”</p>

<p>“Such is my purpose, my dear father, and
has been my practice thus far,” Max returned
with emotion. “Trusting in God it
seems to me is the only thing that can enable
one to go calmly and composedly to the post
of duty when that lies where the messengers
of wounds and death are flying thick and
fast.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” assented the captain.
“Washington, our great and successful commander-in-chief,
was a man of prayer—raised
up, I have no doubt, by a kind Providence,
for the work that he did. And there were
other praying men among our leaders. It
was a fearful struggle, but God helped us and
enabled us to become the free, strong nation
that we are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how thankful we ought to be!” exclaimed
Lucilla. “It seems to me it was a
very ridiculous idea that this great, big country
should be governed by that little one away
across the ocean; especially as she wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
be so tyrannical; for it is certainly true that
‘taxation without representation is tyranny.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Max. “An Englishman, arguing
with me the other day about it, said it
was so small a tax that the colonists were decidedly
foolish to make such a fuss and go
to war to avoid it. I told him it was principle
which made them so determined; because if
they allowed the English Parliament to impose
a small tax without the consent of the
colonies, they might—and would be very
likely to—go on and levy other and much
heavier ones. The colonists were a free-born
people, and meant to remain free; preferring
even death to slavery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” exclaimed Lucilla; “and
that last word of yours, Max, reminds me that
George III. highly approved of the slave
trade and wanted it carried on; and it seems
as if he was by no means averse to enslaving
the whites of this country.”</p>

<p>“Quite desirous to do so; even to the setting
of the savages to the butchering of women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and children,” added Max. “But all that
being so long in the past, he in his grave, and
our liberties secure, it is hardly worth while
now to rake up the faults and failings of the
poor, crazy old king.”</p>

<p>“His granddaughter has proved a much
better and wiser sovereign,” said Lucilla.
“Women do sometimes do better than men.”</p>

<p>“At some things-things not requiring
much physical strength, for example,” the
captain said, with an amused glance down
into his daughter’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes, father, it is certainly true that men
excel us in physical strength; but is that any
reason why women should be paid less for
their work and taxed quite as heavily on their
property—if they happen to have any?” she
concluded with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” was his smiling rejoinder.
“Ah, what is wrong, I wonder!”
as at that instant the man in charge of the
Dolphin was seen coming with swift strides
up from the wharf toward the house. They
stood still, watching him in silence till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
drew near enough for speech; then the captain
asked, “What is it, Mr. Bailey?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Captain Raymond, I have a dreadful
piece of news for you,” was the reply, in a
tone that spoke of disturbed feeling; “news
from Buffalo that President McKinley has
been shot.”</p>

<p>“Shot intentionally? murdered?” asked
the captain, in tones that spoke astonishment
and horror.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; the work of an anarchist of unpronounceable
name. If I had my way
anarchists should be promptly expelled from
this land and forever excluded from it.”</p>

<p>“Is McKinley dead?” asked Max.</p>

<p>“No; but the wound is supposed to be
mortal; noted surgeons are attending him but
have hardly a hope of being able to save his
life.”</p>

<p>“And what have they done with his murderer?”
asked Max. “Torn him limb from
limb?”</p>

<p>“That’s what would have been done by the
crowd in building and street, if the police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hadn’t been able to keep them off till they
could get him into prison.”</p>

<p>“It was what he deserved,” said Max hotly
and with emotion; “but the police did their
duty; every criminal has a right to trial by
judge and jury.”</p>

<p>The voices of those on the porch had been
somewhat raised by excitement, attracting
the attention of those of the family who were
within doors, and bringing them out to learn
what was going on. There were questions
and answers, expressions of grief and horror
and queries as to what had and would be done
with the assassin, what hope might be entertained
of the President’s recovery, and should
he die, would Roosevelt make a good and competent
successor?—that last query coming
from the ladies. The gentlemen at once expressed
the opinion that he would, but also
the hope that McKinley would be spared and
restored to health and strength.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next eight days were with the older
people at Crag Cottage, as with the rest of
the nation, days of anxiety and alternating
hope and fear with regard to the dastardly
attack upon the President of the United
States. After that came the sad news of his
death, and there was mourning all over the
land, but mourning mingled with gladness
that so good and capable a successor had been
provided that the country seemed in no danger.</p>

<p>Eva was able to sit up now a part of each
day, and her baby growing fairer, beginning
to smile and to coo very prettily, thought her
young mother and aunts—to say nothing of
her proud and happy father. Max wanted
to see wife and baby safe in their Sunnyside
home, and all began to talk gaily of soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
starting on their often-made southward trip
in the Dolphin.</p>

<p>Grandma Elsie, doing all in her power for
every one’s welfare and enjoyment, seemed
content to go or to stay, as did her son Harold
and his Grace; it mattered little to them
where they were if only they might be together.
The two couples—Captain Raymond
and Violet, and Mr. and Mrs. Leland—seemed
to enjoy themselves and to feel indifferent
in regard to the exact time of leaving.</p>

<p>The days passed very pleasantly; there
were walks and drives, trips up and down the
river in the Dolphin, hours passed upon the
porch, if the weather were fine, or the parlor,
if it happened to be stormy, in cheerful chat,
amusing games, or listening to interesting
stories from Grandma Elsie or the captain.</p>

<p>And so the days and weeks rolled on until
September was gone and October had come
in. Then they felt that they must go—the
calls from the loved southern homes were so
many and so loud and re-echoed by their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
hearts. They wanted to go, yet it seemed a
trifle saddening to think of leaving this sweet
place on the grand old Hudson River.</p>

<p>The last evening of their stay was lovely
and warm for the season, and until the children’s
bedtime they passed it on the front
porch, where they had a view of the river.</p>

<p>A pause in the conversation was broken by
a request from Elsie Raymond.</p>

<p>“Papa, won’t you tell us about another of
the Revolutionary officers?”</p>

<p>“I am very willing to do so, daughter, but
which shall it be?” the captain asked.</p>

<p>“I should like to hear about General
Greene, if the rest of the folks here would,”
she answered, glancing from one to another.</p>

<p>“I think we would all be pleased to hear
about him,” said Grandma Elsie, “for surely
he was next to Washington in bravery, talent
for the work in hand, and success in using
it.”</p>

<p>So the captain began.</p>

<p>“I think he had no other superior than
Washington in the art and practice of war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
He was a native of Rhode Island, the son
of Quaker parents, brought up to be industrious
and painstaking, and managed to get
a good education largely by his own determined
efforts in private study of ancient and
English history, law, geometry and moral
and political science; he was also fond of
reading books upon war.</p>

<p>“Some few years before the Revolutionary
War he was chosen a member of the Rhode
Island Assembly, and was one of those who
engaged in military exercises as a preparation
for the coming struggle with England
for the freedom which belonged of right to
the people of this land.</p>

<p>“In 1774 he enlisted as private, and in
1775 was appointed to the command of the
Rhode Island contingent of the army at Boston,
with the rank of brigadier-general. He
was with Montgomery and Arnold in their
invasion of Canada. He was made a major-general
in 1775, and distinguished himself
in the battles of Trenton and Princeton.</p>

<p>“He commanded a division at the battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Brandywine and did great service there.
It is said that by his skilful movements then
and there he saved the American army from
utter destruction. He had part in the battle
of Germantown also, commanding the left
wing.</p>

<p>“Soon after the taking of Andre Washington
sent orders to General Greene to put the
left wing of the army near Tappan in motion
as soon as possible, and march toward King’s
Ferry. It was midnight when the express
reached Greene’s quarters; before dawn the
whole division was upon the march. But I
think you are all pretty well acquainted with
the story of Andre, his doings and consequent
end; so I shall not repeat it here and now.”</p>

<p>“But, papa, won’t you go a little more
into the details of the battle of Brandywine?”
asked Grace.</p>

<p>“Certainly, if you wish it,” he replied.
“Greene’s work was very important there.
The British army was very much stronger
than ours—they having eighteen thousand
men, while ours were only eleven thousand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Washington had a very strong position at
Chadd’s and Brinton’s Fords. The British
hoped to drive him from it in turning his
right flank by a circuitous march of eighteen
miles up the Lancaster road and across the
forks of the Brandywine toward Birmingham
meeting-house. The British were safe in trying
to do this, because their force was large
enough to enable them to separate the wings
of their army with little risk. Cornwallis
conducted the movement in an admirable
manner, but did not succeed in striking the
American flank, because Washington made
a new front with his right wing under Sullivan,
near Birmingham meeting-house, so that
Sullivan received the attack on his front.</p>

<p>“A desperate fight ensued, in which the
British army, being so superior in numbers
to ours, at length succeeded in pushing Sullivan
obliquely toward the village of Dilworth.
Had they succeeded in completing that movement
it would have cut the American army in
two and utterly routed it. But Washington
sent a prompt order to General Greene, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
commanded the centre behind Chadd’s Ford.
Washington’s order was to stop the dangerous
gap, and on receiving it Greene immediately
obeyed, marching his troops five miles in forty-five
minutes, and connecting with Sullivan
near Dilworth, he averted the impending
destruction of the army. Wayne had time
to withdraw the centre and Armstrong the
right wing, all in good order, and the whole
army was united at Chester in excellent condition.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” remarked Doctor Harold,
“that was hardly a defeat of our troops—the
same careless writers have vaguely described
the American army as routed at the battle of
Brandywine. Surely an army cannot properly
be said to be routed when it is ready to
begin to fight again the next day.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the captain, “and the fact
that Washington’s manœuvring prevented
Howe’s return to Philadelphia for fifteen
days shows that the Americans were not
routed; and what saved from that was
Greene’s memorable double-quick march to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Dilworth and his admirable manner of sustaining
the fight at that critical point.</p>

<p>“On the 26th of September, Howe, having
eluded Washington on the Schuylkill, entered
Philadelphia, stationing the bulk of his army
in Germantown, and on the 4th of October
the battle of Germantown was fought.
Greene, intending to attack the front of the
British right wing, was delayed by the difficulties
of his route and the mistake of the
guide, so did not get to the field as early as
was planned, and the ground assigned to him
was accidentally occupied by Wayne.</p>

<p>“When victory seemed almost won an unfortunate
mishap turned the tide, and General
Greene again with wonderful skill covered
the retreat.</p>

<p>“In 1778 he was made quartermaster-general,
accepting the office at Washington’s
earnest solicitation, but reserving his right
to command on the field of battle.</p>

<p>“On the 18th of June the British evacuated
Philadelphia, and took up their line of
march through the Jerseys. Hamilton and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Greene urged giving them battle, and on the
28th of June a general attack was made on
Clinton’s forces at Monmouth Court House.</p>

<p>“After the battle Washington marched
northward, crossed the Hudson, and encamped
in Westchester County, while Clinton
continued his retreat to New York.</p>

<p>“And Greene, taking no rest, immediately
attended to the numerous orders and dispositions
required of him as quartermaster-general.</p>

<p>“On the coming of the French fleet it was
decided to make a combined attack upon
Newport. Greene wished to take part in it,
and in August he took up his quarters with
one division of the army at Tiverton.</p>

<p>“But the French had a variety of mishaps,
chief among them the disablement of their
fleet by a tremendous gale.</p>

<p>“Soon afterward Greene went to Philadelphia,
at Washington’s request, to tell Congress
of the late expedition and the causes of
its failure, and there he was received with
distinguished consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“The winter of 1780 was one of great suffering
to the American troops, for the lack
of food and proper shelter. Congress seems
to have been shamefully neglectful of them.</p>

<p>“Greene did so much for his country during
the Revolutionary War that to tell of it
all would make my story too long for to-night;
but I shall try to give you some of
the most interesting items.</p>

<p>“Greene was president of the board convened
for Andre’s trial as a spy in connection
with Arnold’s treason. With tears
Greene signed the decree of the court condemning
Andre to death.</p>

<p>“It has been asserted, but not confirmed,
that Greene cast a deciding vote in the council
against granting Andre’s prayer to be shot
instead of hanged. The reason given was
that if punished at all, Andre should receive
the punishment meted to spies, according to
the laws of war.</p>

<p>“Greene was given the post at West Point
after it was left vacant by Arnold’s treason.
Greene assumed the command early in October,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
1780, but the failure of Gates in the
southern field caused his recall in August,
and by common consent Greene was considered
the best man fit to retrieve the fortunes
of the southern army.</p>

<p>“Congress empowered Washington to ask
Greene to take Gates’ late command. Greene
accepted the offered post and found a formidable
task awaiting him. He took the
command at Charlotte, 2d of December,
1780. In front of him was an army of three
thousand two hundred and twenty-four men
abundantly clothed and fed, well disciplined,
elated with victory and led by an able
general.</p>

<p>“To oppose this force he had an army of
two thousand three hundred and seven, of
whom one thousand four hundred and eighty-two
were present and fit for duty, five hundred
and forty-seven were absent on command,
and one hundred and twenty-eight
were detached on extra service; all these were
half fed, scantily clothed, cast down by defeat,
and many of them defiant of all discipline.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Also the country was infested with
Tories.</p>

<p>“To Greene’s bright mind it was evident
that he could not face Cornwallis with such
inferior numbers, and he resolved to divide
his forces, by which means he might secure
an abundance of food, keep the enemy within
narrow bounds, cut them off from supplies
from the upper country, revive the drooping
spirits of the inhabitants, threaten the posts
and communications of the enemy, and compel
him to delay his threatened invasion of
North Carolina.</p>

<p>“With the purpose of threatening the British
left flank, Morgan was detached with his
famous Maryland brigade, and Colonel
Washington’s light dragoons, to take up a
position near the confluence of Pacolet and
Broad Rivers.</p>

<p>“With the other division, Greene, after a
laborious march through a barren country,
took post at Hick’s Creek on the Pedee, near
the South Carolina line.</p>

<p>“Tarleton was hastening forward with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
troops, expecting to strike a decisive blow at
Morgan, whom it seems he despised, probably
deeming him very inferior to himself in
military knowledge and skill.</p>

<p>“He found Morgan, Colonel Washington
and their troops prepared to receive him
and his. Then followed the battle of the
Cowpens, of which I told you the other
day.</p>

<p>“Cornwallis was furious over that defeat,
and set out at once in pursuit of Morgan,
leaving behind whatever might hinder his
movements.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t catch him,” cried Ned, clapping
his hands with a gleeful laugh.</p>

<p>“No,” said the captain, “Morgan managed
to keep out of his reach, crossed the river first
and kept on into North Carolina.</p>

<p>“But to tell in detail of all Greene’s doings
down there in the Carolinas and Georgia
would make too long a story for to-night.</p>

<p>“On the 9th of February, 1781, Greene,
by a most brilliant march, succeeded in bringing
together the two divisions of his army at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Guilford Court House. He had expected reinforcements
from Virginia, but as they had
not yet arrived, he decided to retreat toward
them and put the broad river Dan between
the enemy and himself. In that he succeeded
without loss of men, baggage or stores.</p>

<p>“Cornwallis had been pursuing him for
two hundred miles, but his troops were now
weary and discouraged by their fruitless
march, and he therefore prudently retired to
Hillsborough.</p>

<p>“However, Greene soon received his reinforcements,
and, crossing the Dan, came to
battle with Cornwallis at Guilford Court
House. That battle was a tactical success for
the British, yet the Americans gained a decided
strategic advantage, for the enemy—too
much shattered to go on with the contest—retired
to Wilmington, and from there
moved into Virginia to effect a junction with
General Phillips.</p>

<p>“Then Greene at once turned southward
with his army. His reasons were given in a
letter to Washington: ‘I am determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
carry the war immediately into South Carolina,’
he wrote. ‘The enemy will be obliged
to follow us, or give up the posts in that state.’
If the enemy did follow, it would take the
war out of North Carolina, where the inhabitants
had suffered great loss from them, and
if the enemy left the posts in South Carolina
to fall, he would lose far more than he could
gain in Virginia.</p>

<p>“In the latter part of April of that year,
the American army established itself in a
strong position on Hobkirk’s Hill, near Camden,
and on the 25th the British, under Lord
Rawdon, attacked it there. It was exactly
what Greene had been preparing for.</p>

<p>“The assault ought to have resulted in the
total ruin of the British army; but through
an accidental misunderstanding of orders,
Greene’s very best men in the Maryland brigade
behaved badly and he was forced to
abandon his position. Yet, as usual, he
reaped the fruits of victory.</p>

<p>“He had sent Marion and Lee to take Fort
Watson, and their effort had been a brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
success, and now obliged Rawdon to abandon
Camden and fall back toward Charleston.</p>

<p>“Greene now had everything in his own
hands, and went on taking fort after fort
from the enemy, and also all the back country
of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>

<p>“Now, Greene’s army had been moving
and fighting for seven months. Of course,
they must have been tired; so he gave them a
rest of about six weeks in a secure position
on the high hills of Santee.</p>

<p>“After that he met the British army, now
under the command of Stuart, in a decisive
action at Eutaw Springs.</p>

<p>“In the morning the British were driven off
the field by a superb charge on their left
flank; but after retreating some distance in
disorder, they rallied in a strong position,
protected by a brick house and palisaded garden,
and succeeded in remaining there during
the afternoon, but only because Greene desisted
from further attack until the cool of
the evening. For thus holding their position
merely on sufferance the British army absurdly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
claimed a victory, and some careless American
writers—who ought to know better—have
repeated the error. Greene foresaw
that the British must retreat at night; they
did so, and he then renewed his attack. They
were chased nearly thirty miles by Marion
and Lee, and very many of them taken prisoners.
Of the two thousand and three hundred
men with whom Stuart had gone into
battle, scarcely more than one thousand
reached Charleston. There they remained
for the next fourteen months, shut up under
the shelter of their fleet.”</p>

<p>“The battle of Eutaw Springs was a great
victory for the Americans, wasn’t it, father?”
asked Grace.</p>

<p>“It was, indeed, a decisive and final one,”
he replied; “at least, so far as the Americans
in South Carolina were concerned. Congress
testified its appreciation of it by a vote
of thanks and a gold medal.”</p>

<p>“What was the date of that battle, father?”
asked Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Battle of Eutaw Springs? Eighth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
September, 1781. On the 14th of December,
1782, Greene marched into Charleston
at the head of his army, and the
next summer, when the army was disbanded,
he went home. On his way there
he stopped in Philadelphia and was greeted
there by enthusiastic crowds and treated
with great consideration by Congress—the
men who had come so near depriving the
country of his services.”</p>

<p>“Was the war over then, papa?” asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>“England had not yet acknowledged our
independence,” replied her father, “but did
so on November 30, 1782, when preliminaries
of peace were signed; those were changed
into a definite peace on September 3,
1783.”</p>

<p>“But is that all the story about General
Greene, papa?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Not quite,” replied his father. “Some
two years after the war was over he removed
to a plantation which the State of Georgia
had presented to him, doubtless in acknowledgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of his great services there in ridding
them of British tyranny. He is said to have
lived there very happily, with a good wife
and many congenial friends, in spite of having,
through the dishonesty of an army contractor
for whom he had become security, to
bear a heavy pecuniary responsibility. He
did not live to be old, dying at the age of
forty-four from sunstroke.”</p>

<p>“What a pity!” exclaimed Elsie. “Had
he any children, papa?”</p>

<p>“Yes; two sons and three daughters.”</p>

<p>“I think they must have been very proud
of their father,” she said, after a moment’s
thoughtful silence. “Thank you, papa, for
telling us about him. I’d like to know about
all my countrymen who have been great and
good and useful.”</p>

<p>“As we all would,” added Lucilla; “and
we may be thankful that we have a father who
is able and kind enough to tell us so much.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” responded Elsie earnestly,
and with a loving look up into her father’s
eyes. “I thank him very much, and hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
I shall never forget the good history lessons
he has given us.”</p>

<p>“And now it is time for my birdlings to go
to their nests,” said Violet, rising and taking
Ned’s hand. “Bid good-night to papa and
the rest and we will go.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Would</span> you enjoy a little stroll about the
grounds before seeking your nest for the
night, dearest?” asked Harold of Grace,
speaking so softly that the words reached no
ear but hers.</p>

<p>“I think I should—with pleasant company,”
she added, a twinkle of fun in her
eyes as she lifted them to his, so full of love
and admiration.</p>

<p>“He who gives the invitation will do his
best to be that,” he returned, offering his arm
as they both rose to their feet.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were seated in
the arbor on the edge of the cliff overlooking
the river—the very place where he had first
told the story of his love and she had acknowledged
its return. Both remembered
that now, and the pleasant story was told
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>A little silence followed, broken presently
by Grace.</p>

<p>“What a lovely scene this is! What a
grand old river! I am always sorry to leave
it, though glad, too, to go home to our own
place in the sunny south.”</p>

<p>“Yes; a winter here would be too cold for
my frail patient,” said Harold, pressing affectionately
the small white hand he held in
his. “For which reason, as well as others,
I am glad we have homes in the sunny south.
I only wish that you and I might at once
make another for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But father won’t allow that for several
years to come; and as he lets us be together
as much as we will, don’t you think we ought
to try to be content to do as he says about—about
the time for marrying?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest; and I really do try to be
content.”</p>

<p>“Yonder lies our yacht. She looks lovely
in the moonlight. I am so glad that we can
go home in her instead of by the public conveyances.
It is such a restful mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
travel, and we can all feel so much at our
ease.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I highly approve of it, especially for
any patient of mine. I hope we are going
to have a speedy and pleasant little voyage.
But now, dearest, your doctor thinks it
would be well for you to go and begin your
night’s rest, as a suitable preparation for
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, rising and taking his arm
again, “and it is not hard to say good-night,
since we are to be together again in the morning.”</p>

<p>They found the porch deserted except by
the captain and Lucilla, who were taking
their usual evening promenade.</p>

<p>“Good-night, father,” said Grace in a lively
tone as she approached him. “My doctor
orders me off to bed, that I may gain strength
for to-morrow’s arduous journey.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he returned, drawing her to him
and giving her a fatherly embrace. “I highly
approve of that prescription, and hope you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
may awake in the morning stronger and better
in health than ever before.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, father dear; and I hope it
won’t be very long before you send Lu to join
me,” said Grace, turning a smiling face toward
her sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say I’ll be up there before you
get your eyes shut for the night,” laughed
Lucilla. “As we don’t any more sleep in adjoining
rooms when at home, I value the
privilege of being near you at night while
here.”</p>

<p>“And it is well for you to be together, so
that if one is sick the other can call the doctor,”
remarked Harold, regarding the two
with a pleased and amused smile.</p>

<p>The next morning found all ready and anxious
to start upon their short voyage. The
yacht was in excellent condition, their trunks
were all packed, the cottage in condition to
be left in charge of the usual caretaker; so
at a reasonably early hour they were all
aboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a lovely day, warm enough for most
of them to be very comfortable on deck while
the sun was shining. The older people sat
together chatting in a lively way while the
children roamed the deck.</p>

<p>At length Elsie Raymond came and sat
down beside her father.</p>

<p>“Tired, daughter?” he asked kindly.</p>

<p>“Not so very much, papa, but I think I’d
like to hear a naval story—it seems as if it
would be suitable while we are here on a vessel,
and I feel sure you must know a good
many of them.”</p>

<p>He laughed a little at that. “Perhaps I
do,” he said, “and I suppose it is natural for
a naval officer’s daughter to crave naval stories.
Shall I tell you of the fight between the
Wasp and Frolic—a fight that took place
during our last war with England?</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, papa,” she answered eagerly, at
the same time beckoning to the other children
to come. They understood, hastened to
gather about the captain, and he began at
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Near the middle of October, 1812—you
know we were then at war with England—the
American gun sloop Wasp, with Jacob Jones
for captain, and a crew of one hundred and
thirty-seven men, left the Delaware and
sailed southeast to get into the tracks of the
West India traders. On the next day she
met a heavy gale, in which she lost her jib-boom
and two men who were on it. By the
seventeenth the weather had moderated somewhat
and she discovered several sail, which
were part of a fleet of armed merchantmen
from Honduras, bound for England, under
convoy of the British eighteen-gun brig-sloop
of war Frolic, of nineteen guns and one hundred
and ten men, and commanded by Captain
Whinyates.</p>

<p>“Those vessels had been dispersed by the
gale the Wasp had passed through. The
Frolic had spent the day in repairing damages,
and by dark six of her convoy had rejoined
her. Four of them mounted from sixteen
to eighteen guns each.</p>

<p>“As Jones drew near he perceived that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
British vessel was disposed to fight, and was
preparing to allow the merchantmen to escape
during the engagement. He at once put the
Wasp under short fighting canvas, and bore
down toward the Frolic, which had lost her
main-yard in the gale; she now lashed her
damaged yard on deck, carried very little sail,
and hoisted Spanish colors to decoy the
stranger and permit her convoy to escape.</p>

<p>“By half-past eleven the ships were not
more than sixty yards apart and began firing—the
Wasp her port, and the Frolic her
starboard battery. The sea was rolling
heavily under a stiff breeze. The Frolic
fired very rapidly, delivering three broadsides
to the Wasp’s two, both crews cheering
loudly; as the ships wallowed through the
water abreast of each other the Americans
fired as the engaged side of their ship was
going down, aiming at the Frolic’s hull, while
the English fired while on the crest of the sea,
their shot going high. The water flew in
clouds of spray over both vessels, they rolling
so that the muzzles of the guns went under.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then they couldn’t fire, could they, uncle?”
asked Eric.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Captain Raymond; “in
spite of that the firing was spirited and well
directed. In five minutes the Wasp’s main-top
mast was shot away. It fell with the
main-top-sail, and lodged so as to make the
head-yards unmanageable during the rest of
the battle. A very few minutes later her gaff
and main-topgallant-mast were shot away,
and very soon her condition seemed helpless.</p>

<p>“But the Frolic had been still more seriously
injured in her hull and lower masts.
She had fired from the crest of the wave, the
Wasp from the trough of the sea, sending her
shot through the hull of the Frolic with destructive
effect. There was a great slaughter
among her crew, but the survivors kept on
with dogged courage.</p>

<p>“At first the two vessels ran side by side,
but the Wasp gradually forged ahead, throwing
in her fire from a position in which she
herself received little injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“At length the bowsprit of the Frolic passed
in over the quarter-deck of the Wasp, forcing
her bows up in the wind. This enabled
the Wasp to throw in a close, raking broadside
with most destructive effect.</p>

<p>“They were so close together that the
Americans struck the Frolic’s side with their
rammers in loading, and they began to rake
the British vessel with dreadful effect.</p>

<p>“When the vessels ran foul of each other
the crew of the Wasp were greatly excited
and could no longer be restrained. With
wild shouts they leaped into the tangled rigging
and made their way to the deck of the
Frolic, carrying dismay to the hearts of its
surviving crew. All of those who were able
had rushed below to escape the raking fire of
the Wasp, excepting an old sailor who had
kept his place at the wheel during the terrible
fight. A few surviving officers were standing
on the quarter-deck of the Frolic, most of
them wounded. They threw down their
swords in token of surrender, when Lieutenant
Biddle, who led the boarding party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
pulled down the British flag with his own
hands.</p>

<p>“A great part of the Frolic’s men were
killed or wounded; not twenty persons on
board had escaped unharmed. It was at a
quarter past twelve that Lieutenant Biddle
hauled down the Frolic’s flag—just forty-three
minutes after the fight began. Her total
loss of men was over ninety, about thirty of
whom were killed outright or died of
wounds.”</p>

<p>“Were there as many killed and wounded
on our vessel, the Wasp?” asked Edward Leland.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the captain; “five of her
men were killed, two in her mizzen-top and
one in her main-top-mast rigging, and five
were wounded, chiefly aloft. She, the
Frolic, had been desperately defended; no
men could have fought more bravely than
Captain Whinyates and his crew. On the
other hand, the Americans had done their
work with coolness; the accuracy with which
they fired was remarkable, and, as the contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
had been mainly one of gunnery, they won
the victory. When the two vessels separated
both masts of the Frolic fell, and tattered
sails and broken rigging covered the dead,
with which her decks were strewn.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Biddle was given charge of
the prize, and the vessels were about parting
company when the British ship of war Poictiers,
seventy-four guns, Captain Beresford,
appeared on the scene. Two hours
after Jones had won his victory his crippled
vessel and more crippled prize were recaptured
by the Poictiers.”</p>

<p>“And all these brave men were made
prisoners, weren’t they, papa?” sighed
Elsie.</p>

<p>“Yes; but they were soon exchanged, and
Congress voted them prize money for their
capture, and promoted Captain Jones and
Lieutenant Biddle. The press lauded Jones.
Delaware, his native State, voted him thanks,
a sword and a piece of silver plate. The Corporation
of New York City voted him a
sword and the freedom of the city. Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
gave him the thanks of the nation and a
gold medal, and appropriated twenty-five
thousand dollars to Jones and his companions
as a compensation for the loss of their prize
by recapture.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” said Elsie, with a sigh
of satisfaction, “for I’m sure they deserved
it.”</p>

<p>“There were some stirring songs made to
commemorate the Wasp’s battle with the
Frolic, were there not?” asked Grandma
Elsie, sitting near.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” replied the captain; “they
were sung everywhere, and by boys in the
street. I think I can recall a stanza of one
given by Lossing in his ‘Story of the United
States Navy’:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘The foe bravely fought, but his arms were all broken,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And he fled from his death-wound, aghast and affrighted;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the Wasp darted forward her death-doing sting,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And full on his bosom, like lightning, alighted.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She pierced through his entrails, she maddened his brain,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And he writhed and he groaned as if torn with the colic;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And long shall John Bull rue the terrible day</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He met the American Wasp on a Frolic.’</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Caricature and satire were pressed into
the service of history. A caricature entitled
‘A Wasp on a Frolic; or, A Sting for John
Bull,’ was sent out by a Philadelphia publisher.”</p>

<p>“Papa, didn’t Lieutenant Biddle get any
presents for his brave deeds on the Wasp
against the Frolic?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned the captain; “he shared in
the honors of the victory. The Legislature
of Pennsylvania voted him a sword, and leading
citizens of Philadelphia presented him
with a silver urn appropriately ornamented
and inscribed.”</p>

<p>The captain paused—there was a moment’s
silence.</p>

<p>“That was a very nice story, papa; thank
you for telling it,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>“Yes, we are all obliged for it, uncle,” said
Eric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“And perhaps would like another one?” returned
the captain inquiringly, and glancing
around upon them with his pleasant smile.</p>

<p>He was answered with a chorus of expressions
of the great pleasure they would all take
in listening to another story of naval doings.
So he began.</p>

<p>“Just a week after the Wasp had won her
victory a still more important one was gained.
In the middle of October, 1812, Commodore
Rodgers sailed from Boston on a second
cruise. His flagship was the President, forty-four
guns, accompanied by the United
States, forty-four, Captain Stephen Decatur,
and Argus, sixteen, Lieutenant-commanding
St. Clair. These vessels soon separated, the
United States sailing southward and eastward,
hoping to intercept British West India-men.</p>

<p>“At dawn on Sunday morning (October
23), near the Island of Madeira, the watch
at the main-top discovered a sail. There was
a stiff breeze and heavy sea at the time. The
vessel was an English man-of-war under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
heavy press of sail, and Decatur resolved to
overtake and fight her.</p>

<p>“His vessel was a good sailer, and gained
rapidly on the one she was pursuing. Her
officers and men were full of enthusiasm, and
as their ship drew near the British vessel they
sent up shouts from their deck that
were heard on board the vessel they were
pursuing; that was before they were near
enough to bring guns to bear upon each other.</p>

<p>“At about nine o’clock that morning Decatur
opened a broadside upon the British
ship, but his balls fell short. However, he
was soon so near that a second broadside from
the United States took effect. The two vessels
were on the same track, and now fought
desperately with long guns, the distance being
so great that carronades and muskets were
of no avail.</p>

<p>“The shot of the United States told fearfully
on her antagonist, and she presently perceived
that the only way to save herself
from utter destruction was to come to
close quarters with her foe. So when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
contest had lasted half an hour, riddled and
torn in hull and rigging, she bore up gallantly
for close action.</p>

<p>“Very soon her mizzen-mast was cut by the
shot of the United States and fell overboard.
Then shortly after, her main-yard was seen
hanging in two pieces; her main and foretopmasts
were gone; her foremast was tottering,
and no colors were seen flying. Her mainmast
and bowsprit were also badly shattered.</p>

<p>“The United States was yet unhurt. Decatur
tacked and came up under the lee of the
English ship. The commander of that vessel
was astounded by the movement, for when
the American vessel bore away he supposed
she was seriously injured and about to fly.
The blaze of her cannon had been so incessant
that, seen through the smoke, the English
captain thought she was on fire. It
seems his crew thought so also, for they gave
three cheers; but when the United States
tacked and came up in a position to do more
serious damage the British commander saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that further resistance was vain, struck his
colors and surrendered.</p>

<p>“As the United States crossed the stern of
her vanquished foe, Decatur called through
his trumpet, ‘What is the name of your ship?’
‘His Majesty’s frigate Macedonian,’ replied
J. S. Carden, her captain.”</p>

<p>“Was she a nice ship, papa?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“She was before the battle, a new ship
and a very fine one of her class. She was
rated at thirty-six guns, but carried forty-nine.
But in this fight she was terribly
bruised and cut up; most of her rigging was
gone, all her boats were shattered into uselessness.
She had received no less than one
hundred round shot in her hull, many of them
between wind and water. Of her officers and
crew, three hundred in number, many were
killed and wounded.”</p>

<p>“What did Decatur do with her, papa?”
asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“He gave up his cruise and returned to
New England with his prize. He went into
the harbor of New London, and Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Allen took the Macedonian into Newport harbor
about the same time. Soon afterward
both vessels sailed for the harbor of New
York, where the Macedonian was first anchored
on New Year’s Day, 1813. One of
that city’s newspapers said of her, ‘She comes
with the compliments of the season from old
Neptune.’</p>

<p>“A splendid banquet had just been given
in that city to Hull, Decatur and Jones, and
all over the Union people were sounding their
praises.”</p>

<p>“And what did the English think about it
all?” asked Eric.</p>

<p>“They were filled with disappointment and
unpleasant forebodings,” replied Captain
Raymond, “while all over the United States
the people were filled with exultation and
hope.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the Legislatures and Congress
make those brave and successful commanders
some gifts to testify to the gratitude of the
people—their countrymen?” asked Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her father. “Legislatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and other bodies gave Decatur thanks and
swords; the Corporation of New York gave
him the freedom of the city, and asked for his
portrait for the picture-gallery in the City
Hall, where it still hangs; and Congress
thanked him and gave him a gold medal.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see that,” said Elsie. “I wonder
if the family have it yet.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said Grandma Elsie. “Such
a thing would be apt to be highly prized and
kept to go down from generation to generation.”</p>

<p>“Ah! whom have we here?” exclaimed the
captain, rising to his feet as at that
moment Max drew near with Eva on his arm.
“Eva, daughter, I am truly glad that you
feel able to join us.”</p>

<p>“And I am very glad to be able, and
permitted by the doctor to do so, father,”
she returned, accepting the seat which he
offered.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is high time you were allowed a
little liberty,” he said, as he and Max seated
themselves with her between them. “Ah!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
here comes my granddaughter,” as the nurse
approached with the babe in her arms.</p>

<p>“Lay her on my lap, please, nurse,” said
Eva. “I am quite able to hold her.”</p>

<p>“And if you find her in the least burdensome,
pass her over to her father,” said Max.</p>

<p>The children gathered round, Ned saying:</p>

<p>“Now, Brother Max, make her talk.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. I’m too young,” came
apparently from the baby lips, and all the
children laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s rude for big folks like you to laugh
at a little one like me,” she seemed to say in
a hurt tone.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t; but I don’t mean to do it
again, though I am your aunt,” laughed Elsie.</p>

<p>“Are you? Then you ought to be very good
to me,” the baby voice seemed to say.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I intend to be,” returned Elsie.
“I love you because you are a dear little soul,
and my little niece—your father and mother
being my brother and sister.”</p>

<p>“Elsie isn’t your only relation here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
though,” said Alie; “there are a good many
of us. I’m one of your cousins.”</p>

<p>“And I’m another,” said Eric, “and big
Brother Edward is another, and so is little
Sister Vi. You have a good many relations;
plenty of them—such as they are.”</p>

<p>“I hope to get acquainted with them all
after awhile,” returned the baby voice, “but
I’m tired talking.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! she gets tired sooner than some
other folks,” laughed Edward, turning away.
“I guess she’ll not grow up into a gossip about
other folks’ matters.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said Eva; “but I see she is
going to sleep now, so no wonder she’s tired of
talking.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> good dinner was served on board
the Dolphin that day, and on leaving the table
most of her passengers sought the deck
again, for it was a lovely evening, warm and
clear.</p>

<p>The captain and Violet were sitting side by
side on a settee, when Elsie came to them
with a wistful, inquiring look on her face that
made her father think she wanted something.</p>

<p>“What is it, my little daughter?” he asked,
drawing her to a seat upon his knee.</p>

<p>“If it wouldn’t be too much trouble for you
to tell me about the War of 1812, papa, I
should be glad to learn more about it,” she
said.</p>

<p>“It will be no trouble for me to give my
dear little girl as much information as she
may crave about it,” he answered, patting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
cheek affectionately. “But if you think the
other children will care to hear what I tell
you, you may call them here before I begin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, papa, I will,” she answered joyously,
and hastened away in search of them.</p>

<p>Her summons was obeyed by one and all,
as if in expectation of a great treat. They
gathered about the captain and he began.</p>

<p>“We are now at peace with England; the
two nations good friends, as I hope and trust
they may be always. But between the wars
of the Revolution and of 1812 this country
was badly treated by that in more ways than
one. To tell you all about it would make
much too long a story for to-night. Lossing
says of England in 1810 that she had seized
and confiscated the commercial property of
American citizens to an incalculable amount.
She had contemptuously disregarded the neutrality
of the American territory, and the
jurisdiction of the American laws within the
waters and harbors of the United States.
She had at that time impressed from the
crews of American merchant vessels peaceably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
navigating the high seas not less than six
thousand mariners who claimed to be citizens
of the United States, and who were denied all
opportunity to verify their claims. I think
it was in February, 1811, that a richly laden
American vessel bound for France was captured
by a British cruiser within thirty miles
of New York City; and early in May a British
frigate stopped an American brig only
eighteen miles from New York and a young
man, known to be a native of Maine, was
taken from her and impressed into the British
service. Other such instances had occurred,
and often the men thus shamefully
robbed of their freedom were most cruelly
treated.”</p>

<p>“How, papa?” asked Ned. “What did they
do to them?”</p>

<p>“For refusing to work for their captors, especially
after hearing of the declaration of
war in 1812; some American sailors were
most cruelly used; three who had been impressed
on board the British vessel Peacock
refused to fight against their country and demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to be treated as prisoners of war.
They were ordered to the quarter-deck, put
in irons for twenty-four hours, then taken to
the gangway, stripped naked, tied and
whipped, each one dozen and a half, and put
to duty.</p>

<p>“When the Peacock went into action with
the Hornet, they asked the captain to be sent
below, that they might not fight against their
countrymen. The captain called a midshipman
and told him to do his duty, which was
to hold a pistol to the head of Thompson and
threaten to blow his brains out if he and his
companions did not do service.”</p>

<p>“How glad they must have been when
the Hornet took the Peacock!” exclaimed
Eric.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! For they had certainly been
very cruelly used by those who had stolen
them from American vessels,” said the captain.
“And there were others who received
still more cruel treatment from them, the
robbers of the American seamen. It was no
wonder that America was roused to attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a second war with Great Britain in order to
stop these dreadful outrages upon her people.”</p>

<p>“The navy did a great deal in that war,
didn’t it, uncle?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the captain; “they were
more successful than the land forces.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please tell us some of their doings!”
cried several children’s voices.</p>

<p>The captain mused a moment, then began.</p>

<p>“I will tell you some of the doings of Commodore
Rodgers in his favorite frigate, the
President. After some unsuccessful efforts
to intercept vessels trading between the
West Indies and Halifax, St. Johns and Quebec,
but finding none, he determined
to try his fortune in the North Sea in search
of British merchantmen. But he did not
meet with a single vessel until he made the
Shetland Islands, and there he found only
Danish ships trading to England. His supplies
began to fail and he went to North Bergen,
in Norway, to replenish his stock. There
he was disappointed, too, for there was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
scarcity of food all over the country
and he could procure nothing but water.</p>

<p>“It seems he knew that a fleet of merchantmen
were to sail from Archangel in the middle
of July. But just as he expected to make
some prizes from among them, he fell in with
two British ships of war. Knowing that he
was not strong enough to battle with both at
once, Rodgers with his vessel fled, hotly pursued
by the enemy. (At that season in that
northern region the sun is several degrees
above the horizon at midnight.) That enabled
the vessels to keep up the chase more
than eighty hours, during which time they
were much nearer the President than was at
all agreeable to her officers and men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope they didn’t catch her!” exclaimed
Elsie.</p>

<p>“No,” said her father, “she escaped from
them. Her stock of provisions had been replenished
from two vessels that had been
taken before the war vessels had appeared,
and now she turned westward to intercept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
vessels coming out of and going into the Irish
Channel.</p>

<p>“In the next six or seven days he (Rodgers)
captured three vessels; then he thought
it best to change his course, as the enemy was
in that vicinity with a superior force. He
made a complete circuit of Ireland, then
steered for the banks of Newfoundland, near
which he made two more captures. From
these he learned that two British vessels, the
Bellerophon and Hyperion frigate, were only
a few miles from him. However, he did not
fall in with them, and soon stood for the
coast of the United States.</p>

<p>“Toward evening on the 23d of September
the President fell in with the British
armed schooner Highflyer, tender to Admiral
Warren’s flagship St. Domingo; she was
commanded by Lieutenant Hutchinson; was
a fine vessel of her class—a fast sailer. When
discovered she was six or seven miles distant,
but by a stratagem Commodore Rodgers decoyed
her alongside and captured her without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
firing a gun. She did not even discover
that the President was her enemy until the
stratagem had succeeded.</p>

<p>“Before starting upon this cruise Rodgers
had placed in his possession some of the British
signals. He had had some made on board
his ship, and now he resolved to try their efficacy.
He hoisted an English ensign over the
President. The Highflyer answered by displaying
another, and at the same time a signal
from a mast-head.</p>

<p>“To Rodgers’s delight, he discovered that
he possessed its complement. He then signalled
that his vessel was the Sea Horse, one
of the largest of its class known to be then
on the American coast. The Highflyer at
once bore down, hove to under the stern of
the President and received one of Rodgers’s
lieutenants on board, who was dressed in
British uniform. He bore an order from
Rodgers for the commander of the Highflyer
to send his signal books on board to be altered,
as some of the Yankees, it was alleged, had
obtained possession of some of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“The unsuspecting lieutenant obeyed, and
Rodgers was put in possession of the key to
the whole correspondence of the British navy.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon the commander of the Highflyer
followed his signal books. He was
pleased with everything he saw on board what
he believed was the English vessel Sea Horse,
and admired even the scarlet uniform of
Rodgers’s marines, whom he took for British
soldiers. Invited into the cabin, he placed in
the commodore’s hands a bundle of dispatches
for Admiral Warren, and informed his supposed
friend that the main object of the British
commander on the American station at
that time was the capture or destruction of
the President, which had been greatly annoying
and destroying British commerce and
spreading alarm throughout British waters.</p>

<p>“The commodore asked what kind of a man
Rodgers was. ‘An odd fish and hard to
catch,’ replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ said Rodgers most emphatically,
‘do you know what vessel you are on board
of?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Why, yes,’ he replied; ‘on board His
Majesty’s ship Sea Horse.’</p>

<p>“‘Then, sir, you labor under a mistake,’
said Rodgers. ‘You are on board the United
States frigate President, and I am Commodore
Rodgers, at your service.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, how frightened that British man
must have been!” exclaimed Elsie. “Wasn’t
he, papa?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that at first he thought all the
commodore had been saying was merely a
joke,” replied her father. “He seemed astounded,
and it was difficult to make him believe
that he was really on an American
vessel. But the band on the President’s
quarterdeck was playing ‘Yankee Doodle,’
and over it the American ensign was displayed,
while the uniforms of the marines
were suddenly changed from red to blue.</p>

<p>“It would seem that Hutchinson might
well feel alarmed at finding himself in the
hands of Rodgers, for he had been one of
Cockburn’s subalterns when that marauder
plundered and burned Havre de Grace a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
months before; and it is said that Lieutenant
Hutchinson had now in his possession a
sword which he carried away from Commodore
Rodgers’s house on that occasion.</p>

<p>“He had been warned by Captain Oliver,
when receiving instructions as commander of
the Highflyer, to take care not to be outwitted
by the Yankees. ‘Especially be careful,’ said
Oliver, ‘not to fall into the hands of Commodore
Rodgers, for if he comes across you he
will hoist you upon his jib-boom and carry
you into Boston.’”</p>

<p>“And did he do it, now he’d got him?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No,” said Captain Raymond. “Well was
it for him that the enemy into whose hands
he had fallen was an American. Rodgers
treated him with courtesy such as is due to a
prisoner of war, and soon allowed him to go
at large on parole.”</p>

<p>“And did Commodore Rodgers get back
to his own country, papa?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“Yes; three days after the capture of the
Highflyer he sailed into Newport harbor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
having his prize with him, her commander
and fifty-five other prisoners. He said his
cruise had not added much lustre to the
American navy, but he had rendered his country
signal service by harassing the enemy’s
commerce, and keeping more than twenty vessels
in search of him for several weeks. He
had captured eleven merchant vessels and two
hundred and seventy-one prisoners.”</p>

<p>“What could he do with so many prisoners,
uncle?” asked Eric. “I should hardly think
he’d have room for them in his ship.”</p>

<p>“All but those he carried into Newport
had been paroled and sent home in the captured
vessels,” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“Did he go out catching British ships
again, uncle?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>“Yes; on the 5th of December, 1813, he
sailed from Newport on another cruise in the
President. He expected to fall in with the
British squadron, but with a stiff breeze from
the north-northwest he got well to sea without
falling in with them. The next day he
captured the Cornet, which British cruisers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
had taken from the Americans; then he sailed
southward. In the vicinity of the Barbadoes
he took, one after another, three British merchantmen.
He ran down into the Caribbean
Sea and cruised there unsuccessfully for
awhile, but finally captured and sunk a British
merchantman, then sailed for the coast of
Florida.</p>

<p>“Going northward, he was off Charleston
Bar on the 11th of February. He did
not enter it, however, but continued on up
the coast, chasing and being chased, dashing
through a vigilant British blockading squadron
off Sandy Hook, and sailed into New
York harbor on the evening of the eighteenth.”</p>

<p>“Then New York did him honor, didn’t
she, father?” said Grace, sitting near, listening
to his story.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the captain; “many of the
citizens did so, and a dinner was given in
compliment to him at Tammany Hall. At
that dinner, where most of the notables of
the city were present, Rodgers gave this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
toast: ‘Peace, if it can be obtained without
the sacrifice of national honor or the abandonment
of maritime rights; otherwise, war
until peace shall be secured without the sacrifice
of either.’”</p>

<p>“A good toast. I like the sentiment expressed,”
said Grace. “I think I have read
that a good many gentlemen were present
there at the dinner.”</p>

<p>“Yes, more than three hundred; many of
them shipmasters,” said the captain. “A
toast was given to the commodore, followed
by eighteen cheers, and a song that some one
had written in his honor that morning was
sung.”</p>

<p>“Papa,” said Elsie, “was it right for him
to put the name of a British vessel on his,
and British uniform on his marines, to deceive
the British on the Highflyer so that
they would come to him and be taken prisoners?”</p>

<p>“No, daughter, I do not think it was,” replied
the captain, “though, no doubt, the motive
of all of them was good—to defend their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
country and countrymen from robbery and
oppression. But it is never right to do evil
that good may come. My good mother’s
teaching was, ‘You should die rather than tell
a lie, though it were no more than to deny
that two and two make four.’ But, no doubt,
Rodgers thought his manœuvres all right and
fair; and they certainly inflicted no wrong
upon the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Is that all the story about him, papa?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Just about,” replied his father. “His
good ship, the President, now needed a thorough
overhauling, and the Secretary of the
Navy offered Commodore Rodgers the command
of the Guerriere, the ship which Hull
took from Dacres, and which might be made
ready for sea much sooner than the President.
The commodore went to Philadelphia,
where the Guerriere was being put in order,
and, finding that she was not so nearly
ready as he had supposed, he informed the
Secretary that he preferred to retain command
of the President. But in the meantime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the President had been offered to Decatur.
Rodgers courteously allowed that
commander to take his choice of vessels, and
he chose the President. Now, my dears, I
think we may consider our naval studies
ended for to-night.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> homeward trip of the Dolphin was a
speedy and successful one. Her passengers,
healthy and happy, enjoyed it greatly, yet
were rejoiced when she cast anchor, one
lovely morning, in the harbor near their
homes, where they were wont to leave her,
to travel the few remaining miles on land.</p>

<p>They had been expected at about that time,
and Edward and Zoe Travilla were there to
meet them. Grandma Elsie was the first to
step on shore, and Edward caught her in his
arms with a glad exclamation:</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, I am so rejoiced to have you
at home again! We can’t do without you.
We have missed you every day and every
hour.”</p>

<p>“And I am very, very glad to be here with
you all again,” she returned; “you among
them, Zoe. Ah, Herbert, my son,” as at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
moment he and Dr. Conly appeared on the
scene, “your mother is rejoiced to see you
also, looking so bright and well. You, too,
Cousin Arthur,” giving a hand to him. “Are
all the dear ones well?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And, oh! but we are glad to have
you home again,” both physicians answered,
then turned to welcome the others, who were
stepping ashore.</p>

<p>It was a most affectionate greeting all
round, even the little newcomer sharing in
it. Then Edward said:</p>

<p>“Now, friends and cousins, we want you
all at Ion for the rest of the day. A big
enough dinner has been prepared, and every
one of you will be as welcome as possible.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly very kind and hospitable
in you, Brother Ned,” said Mrs. Leland,
“but I really think we would better take ourselves
and our luggage to our own homes first
and visit you later on, a few at a time.”</p>

<p>“No, Elsie, dear,” he returned, “we have
made the plans and preparations, and shall
feel greatly disappointed if not permitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
carry out our scheme. Come one, come all,
and let us have a jolly time together.”</p>

<p>Just then Chester Dinsmore came hurrying
toward them, having just learned in his
office of the arrival of the vessel. A joyous,
affectionate greeting exchanged between him
and Lucilla, his wife, he turned to the other
returned travellers. Then Edward renewed
his invitation, adding:</p>

<p>“I have been out to each one of your homes
and seen that they are all in prime order for
you, but told the caretakers that you were
to dine with us at Ion first; therefore, they
need not expect you until evening, or somewhere
near it.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, indeed, Brother Ned,”
said Captain Raymond, “and if my wife and
the others are willing to accept your advice—your
most hospitable invitation—I shall be
happy to do so.”</p>

<p>“I should like to,” said Violet; “but what
about the baggage, <i>et cetera</i>?”</p>

<p>“Those things can all be sent out immediately
to our homes and safely entrusted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the caretakers Brother Ned just spoke of,”
said the captain.</p>

<p>All now accepted Edward’s invitation, entered
the waiting carriages and were driven
at once along the good and pleasant road to
Ion. There they found a gathering of all
the relatives in that region—Dr. Conly’s
family, Calhoun’s also, Rose Croly, with
her husband and children, the Dinsmores
from the Oaks, the Laceys from the Laurels,
Cousin Ronald and his Annis, Hugh and his
wife and children. It was now nearly a year
since Captain Raymond and his party had
sailed away in the Dolphin, and the reunion
of so many friends and relatives gave much
undisguised pleasure.</p>

<p>It was a large company, but with nothing
stiff or formal about it; there were many loving
embraces and much cheerful, happy, familiar
chat, and soon they gathered about the
hospitable board to regale themselves with
dainty and delicious fare, the meal enlivened
by an interchange, suited to the occasion, of
thoughts, feelings and experiences. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
was a feast of reason and a flow of soul, accompanied
by no gluttony or gormandizing.</p>

<p>Conversation and many courses kept them
long at the table. But at length they left it
and gathered in the parlors. They had not
been there long when Laurie and Lily came
in, bringing the tee-tees—the little monkeys
belonging to Elsie and Ned Raymond. They
were delighted to see their pets and thought
the pleasure was mutual, though the older
people had doubts concerning the evidences
of pleasure given by the monkeys.</p>

<p>The nurse had had the care of Evelyn’s
baby while the dinner was in progress, but
now she brought it in and laid it in the mother’s
lap while she should go and take her
meal. Several of the cousins gathered about
to look at the little one, and spoke admiringly
of her appearance.</p>

<p>“She is a little beauty,” said more than
one.</p>

<p>Then a weak little voice seemed to come
from her lips:</p>

<p>“Don’t make me vain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, darling. You are too young for
that,” laughed Grandma Elsie, “as well as
too young to talk so wisely and well.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; but my papa helps me,”
murmured the weak little voice, and everybody
looked at Max and laughed.</p>

<p>“What a nice little truth-speaker you are,
little niece,” said Lucilla, leaning over the
babe and softly touching its cheek.</p>

<p>“I want to be that always, auntie,” replied
the same little voice which had spoken before.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a good little thing you are,”
laughed Ned. “I’m glad to be your uncle.”</p>

<p>“Tell him he’s too young and small to be
of much use as an uncle,” said a voice that
seemed to come from some one behind the
group about the baby.</p>

<p>Instantly every head was turned to see who
the speaker was. But he seemed to be invisible.</p>

<p>“Why, who said that?” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know. It was you, Cousin Ronald.”</p>

<p>“Some people are wonderfully wise,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Mr. Lilburn. “But really, now, did that
sound like my voice?”</p>

<p>“Like one of them, I think,” laughed Ned.
“You seem to have a good many; even more
than Brother Max has.”</p>

<p>Ned had his tee-tee on his shoulder, and
it seemed now to put in its word:</p>

<p>“Is that the way to talk to your old, old
cousin?”</p>

<p>“Is that the way you talk to me, you saucy
fellow?” laughed Ned, giving the tee-tee a
little shake.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Lily Travilla. “That’s
the first time he’s spoken since we brought
him away from Louisiana in the Dolphin.”</p>

<p>“I can’t talk when there’s nobody by to
help me,” was the tee-tee’s next remark.</p>

<p>“And Cousin Ronald is helping you now,
isn’t he?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; and he’s good help.”</p>

<p>Elsie had Tiny on her shoulder, and she
put in her word now:</p>

<p>“I think it’s my turn to talk a little. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
glad my little mistress has come home, though
I’ve had a good time on the yacht and here
with these good folks.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you have had a good time,”
laughed Elsie, “and I promise you shall have
a fine time at Woodburn, my home, where I’ll
take you presently.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me run about on the porches
and the grass and climb the trees?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, as much as you like, if you
won’t run away from your home,” answered
Elsie, hugging and stroking her pet.</p>

<p>“Now, if aunts, uncles and cousins will
step aside for a moment, her grandfather
would like to take a peep at baby,” said Captain
Raymond, coming up behind the group
of children.</p>

<p>They all hastily stepped aside and he
leaned over the babe and chirruped to it. It
looked up into his face and laughed, as if it
knew and cared for him.</p>

<p>“Ah, you really seem to know and approve
of your grandpa,” he said laughingly. “Evelyn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
my dear, she’s a darling, a pretty little
pet.”</p>

<p>“So Max and I think, father,” returned
the happy young mother.</p>

<p>“And so, I think I may say, do we all,” said
old Mr. Dinsmore. “I should not at all object
to counting her among my great-great-grandchildren.”</p>

<p>“Nor would we to having you do so, sir,”
said Max, coloring and smiling with pleasure,
for he was very proud of his little daughter
and glad to have her admired by others.</p>

<p>“I am proud and fond of the little dear,
call myself her uncle now, and hope to be
really such one of these days,” laughed Harold.</p>

<p>“We all hope so,” said Max, “and have no
objection to your claiming that relationship
at once.”</p>

<p>There had been some alterations and improvements
made in house and grounds since
the Dolphin and her passengers started on
that winter trip, and presently most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
company went about viewing them, and that
with entire satisfaction and approval.</p>

<p>But the sun was now nearing the horizon,
and the Woodburn and Sunnyside folk were
growing eager to see and rest in their own
loved and comfortable homes. The carriages
were brought up, the adieus said, and they
went on their way rejoicing. Each family
went to its own dwelling at first, but they
would not be long apart; that evening would
see them all gathered, first at one residence,
then at the other, and there would never be
a day that would not be spent more or less
in each other’s society. This would be true
of all excepting Max, who must soon return
to his ship. The thought of that was all that
marred the happiness of that evening, with
its joyful return to their own loved homes.
But Evelyn and all of them tried to put away
remembrance of it for the present.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Home</span>, sweet home!” exclaimed Lucilla
as their carriage turned into the driveway on
that first evening after the Dolphin had come
into port. “Home, sweet home! There’s no
place like home.”</p>

<p>“Except Woodburn, our dear old home,”
returned Max in jesting tone.</p>

<p>“No; Woodburn and Sunnyside-so near
together, and their inhabitants so nearly related—seem
to make but one home to me.”</p>

<p>“And to us all, I think,” said Evelyn.</p>

<p>“And you are right, I am sure,” said Chester,
as the carriage drew up before the entrance.
“Ah, here we are at the very threshold
of our Sunnyside! Wife, brother
and sister, a glad welcome home to you all.”
With the last word he threw open the carriage
door, sprang out upon the veranda steps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
turned and helped Lucilla to alight. Max,
his wife and baby followed.</p>

<p>A joyous welcome was given them all by
the waiting servants, and they passed in, each
couple to their own part of the commodious
and beautiful dwelling.</p>

<p>“Welcome home, my darling,” said Max to
his wife. “Welcome home, baby dear, papa’s
sweet little pet,” taking the infant in his arms
as he spoke. “Oh, Eva, my love, how rich
we are, with her added to all our other lesser
blessings!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, we are! She is a great blessing,”
said Eva, caressing the child as he held it in
his arms. “To me she seems more than all
others taken together-except her father,”
she added, smiling up into his face.</p>

<p>“And to me she is the next one to her
mother,” responded Max, bestowing a very
loverlike caress upon his wife as she stood
close at his side. “How good my father has
been to provide us with this lovely home, so
near to his that we seem to belong to his family
still.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she said with emotion. “And what
a dear father he is! I am so glad and thankful
that he seems to look upon me as his very
own daughter. I had been so hungry for a
father after my own was taken to the better
land.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest, I think I can understand
that hunger, though I have been spared the
sad experience,” replied Max, his tone speaking
even more sympathy than his words.</p>

<p>“And, oh,” he added, “I want my little
wife to be the most blessed, happy woman in
the world.”</p>

<p>“I ought to be; and I think I am when my
husband is with me,” she returned with a
smile of love and joy. “What is it, Kitty?”
as a servant came in, looking as if she had
some pleasant news to impart.</p>

<p>“Why, missus, dere’s sumfin’ jus’ come
over from Woodburn. De cap’n he sends it
for de baby,” replied the woman, grinning
broadly as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Ah, is that so?” asked Max. “Where and
what is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sumfin’ for de baby to ride in, sah, an’
it’s out on de poach,” she answered, hurriedly
leading the way, Eva and Max following, he
with the baby still in his arms.</p>

<p>They presently found on the front veranda
as handsome a baby carriage as either
of them had ever seen, and were both delighted
with it. It was ready furnished with
pillows, and a beautiful afghan of a most
delicate shade of baby-blue silk lined with
white silk, covered with white duchess lace,
with blue ribbon bows on each corner,
to match the umbrella, it being of the same
shade, and also covered with duchess lace. On
a corner of the afghan was pinned a bit of
paper bearing the words: “From Grandmamma
Vi to little Mary Raymond.” On
the under side of the afghan were the initials
“M. R.” in blue embroidery silk.</p>

<p>Max laid the baby in, Evelyn covered her
carefully with the afghan, and for some minutes
Max drew her back and forth on the veranda,
she cooing as if enjoying the ride.</p>

<p>Chester and Lucilla had quite a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to tell each other of their experiences during
the past weeks of separation, and were chatting
and laughing merrily in her pretty boudoir,
when some slight sounds made by the
baby and its parents and carriage excited
their curiosity and brought them hurrying
downstairs to learn what was going on
there.</p>

<p>“Oh, how pretty!” cried Lucilla, as she
caught sight of the little vehicle. “How fine
for our darling baby! Where did it come
from?”</p>

<p>“It is father’s gift,” answered Max; “the
dear, kind father who always thinks of everything
he can possibly do to add to the happiness
of his children.”</p>

<p>“He does, indeed!” exclaimed Evelyn.
“Nobody could have a better, kinder father.”</p>

<p>“We are all going over to Woodburn this
evening,” said Max, “and we will take baby
in her carriage.”</p>

<p>“She, as queen of the party, will ride,
and the rest of us will walk,” laughed Lucilla.
“Oh, you little darling, auntie hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
you will always be able to ride when you want
to.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless she will if it is best for her,”
said Max. “It looks now as if she were born
for easy times, but no one can tell what may
be in store for either us or her in the future.”</p>

<p>“Father would say, ‘Don’t allow yourself
to be troubled with anxiety in regard to the
future; remember the teaching of the Thirty-seventh
Psalm, Trust in the Lord, and do
good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and
verily thou shalt be fed,’” said Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Evelyn, “if we all had perfect
trust in Him, I am sure we should be
free from anxiety and very happy.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you are right about that,” said
Chester, “and if we practise it—that teaching—we
shall be a happy set.”</p>

<p>“I hear our call to supper,” said Lucilla.
“Eva, won’t you and Max come in and sup
with us?”</p>

<p>“Do, friends and relatives; we will be very
glad to have you partake with us,” said Chester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you both,” said Max. “I think
our supper is just about ready, but if you will
allow its dishes to be added to yours we may
share with each other, and probably enjoy doing
so.”</p>

<p>All agreed that that was a good idea, and
the plan was immediately carried out.</p>

<p>The Sunnyside folks were not more glad
to see their home than were the Woodburn
people to reach theirs. The captain’s carriage
contained, not his own family only, but
his future son-in-law also. Harold was bidding
an affectionate good-bye to Grace on the
veranda at Ion when her father said laughingly:</p>

<p>“Don’t indulge in adieus just here and
now, Harold, but come with us to Woodburn.
Who can tell but there may be a patient there
longing for a sight of Dr. Harold Travilla’s
face?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, captain; a kind invitation,
and flattering to my medical and surgical
skill and supposed desire to be helpful to
others; but I should be sorry to crowd you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>He and her father were helping Grace into
the vehicle as he spoke.</p>

<p>“There’s abundance of room, Harold,” said
Violet; “get right in and take that seat beside
Grace.”</p>

<p>“Yes, obey that lady’s orders as I do,”
laughed the captain.</p>

<p>“I thought I had outgrown that business,”
laughed Harold; “but I will obey in a moment,
when I have said good-night to mother
and the rest.”</p>

<p>That did not take long, and the captain’s
“Plenty of time for that” seemed to afford
satisfactory permission. In five minutes the
carriage was on its way down the avenue.</p>

<p>“Now, Tiny, you are on your way to that
pretty home I’ve been telling you about,” said
Elsie, stroking and patting her little pet
monkey.</p>

<p>“What are you telling her for, Elsie?”
asked Ned. “Why don’t you wait and let
her be surprised when she gets there? Surprises
are nice. I always like to be surprised.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Something of a mistake, Ned,” said his
uncle. “Some surprises are far from agreeable.”</p>

<p>“What kind, uncle? please tell me about
some.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have heard of it happening to a
man to learn that all of a sudden he had lost
all his money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s not so bad. He could earn
more.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he could; but if so, he’d a good
deal rather add that to what he had before
than have only that.”</p>

<p>“There must be a good many kinds of surprises,”
returned the little fellow thoughtfully,
“and I’d rather have some other kind than
that. When papa gave me my pony, that
was a very pleasant surprise. Oh, I was just
delighted.”</p>

<p>“And these tee-tees were a very, very
agreeable surprise to both of us,” said Elsie,
patting and stroking hers, seated in her
lap.</p>

<p>“And I’m thinking Eva and Max will soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
have a very agreeable surprise,” said Grace,
smiling up into her father’s face.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” he said, returning the smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, what about?” queried Ned, with tone
and look of curiosity and excitement.</p>

<p>“No doubt you will learn when they—your
brothers and sisters—come over to Woodburn
this evening,” answered his father.</p>

<p>“Will I?” cried Ned. “Oh, I hope they’ll
come early; at least, before Elsie and I have
to go to bed.”</p>

<p>At that everybody laughed, and his mother
quietly remarked that she was surprised to
find him exhibiting so much curiosity, as it
seemed to be understood that that quality belonged
rather to women and girls than to men
and boys.</p>

<p>“Quite a mistake and slander, my dear,”
laughed her husband, then changed the subject
of conversation by calling attention
to a new building going up on a neighboring
plantation.</p>

<p>A few minutes later their carriage turned
into the Woodburn driveway, and presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
they were leaving it for the veranda of the
spacious and lordly dwelling where the servants
were assembled, Christine, their lady-like
housekeeper, at their head, to welcome
the returned travellers to their home. Everybody
seemed full of joy over it; and the children
were delighted with the curiosity shown
in regard to their new pets and the to-do made
over them.</p>

<p>A bountiful and most appetizing repast
had been prepared for their reception, and
they presently seated themselves about the
table. A blessing was asked, and the captain
began carving a fine turkey, Violet pouring
the tea. The table was charmingly furnished
with beautiful china, cut-glass, silver,
flowers, and dishes of most appetizing-looking
food.</p>

<p>“It is really very pleasant to be at home
and at one’s own table again,” remarked the
captain, after an appreciative glance over the
board.</p>

<p>“Whose table was it that you sat down to
on the Dolphin?” laughed Violet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“My own, I believe,” smiled the captain;
“but, somehow, I feel more at home here.”</p>

<p>“It is delightful to be here; but I miss Lu,”
sighed Grace.</p>

<p>“Well, daughter, she is not far off. Keep
up your spirits; she will probably be here in
the course of an hour.”</p>

<p>“Husband, brother, sister, baby and all
with her, I presume,” added Harold sportively.
“And baby will probably come in her
own coach, like the grand lady she is,”
laughed Violet. “I shall enjoy seeing her
in it.”</p>

<p>“Resting on and covered by the beautiful
furnishings provided by your generosity and
taste, mamma,” said Grace, with a loving, appreciative
look at her young stepmother.</p>

<p>“Are we going to have a party to-night?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said his father; “at least,
it will be only a home party of what I call
our own immediate family—my children and
grandchild.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks, my dear captain, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
seem to be included in the number forming
that happy family,” said Harold, with a bow
and pleased smile.</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Violet, “but don’t imagine
that I am going to permit you to call me
mamma, considering that you are my younger
brother.”</p>

<p>“So I am, Mrs. Raymond; but by no means
young enough to be an obedient son to you,”
Harold returned in playful tone, “or, indeed,
any son at all. It will be well enough to bear
that relationship to your husband, but fairly
ludicrous to pretend to bear it to so young
and fair a lady as yourself.”</p>

<p>“I should think the fairness would make it
a trifle less objectionable, if anything could,”
returned Violet with mischievous look and
smile.</p>

<p>“Really, those mutual relationships make
small difference, except as they may affect
your docility when you are the patient and I
the physician,” returned Harold gravely.</p>

<p>“All of us obey your orders when you are
the doctor, uncle,” remarked Elsie. “Sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Grace never will do a thing that you tell her
not to.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” laughed Grace. “Where
would be the use of employing a physician, if
you didn’t follow his directions?”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meal all repaired
to the veranda to await the coming of the Sunnyside
folk. It was a warm October evening,
the grounds looking beautiful in their
autumn robes, and there seemed no pleasanter
place to lounge in than that, with its abundance
of most comfortable settees and chairs.</p>

<p>“It is very nice to be at home again,” said
Grace with a happy sigh. “I wouldn’t be
willing to give up this dear home for any of
the beautiful places I have been in.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you are so well satisfied, daughter,”
the captain responded in a pleased tone,
“and I hope you will never have less love for
your father’s house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good, good! There they come!”
cried Ned, springing to his feet and clapping
his hands as the little group was seen approaching
from the direction of Sunnyside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, children and grandchild,” said the
captain, as he and Harold hurried to meet
them.</p>

<p>“Many, many thanks, father, for this beautiful
and useful gift to our baby daughter,”
said Max almost before they had fairly
met.</p>

<p>“And not from baby’s father only, but
from her mother also,” said Evelyn; “many,
many thanks to you and Mamma Vi for both
the carriage and its lovely furnishings.”</p>

<p>“Ah, those last are gifts especially from
my wife,” returned the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes, I know and appreciate it;
but, no doubt, they were given with your approval.
Ah, Mamma Vi,” as Violet approached,
“I hardly know how to thank you
enough for your lovely gifts to my baby
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t try,” returned Violet in mirthful
tones. “I assure you, the pleasure I
found in doing it was reward enough. How
is the little dear this evening? Ah, I see she
is sound asleep. How nicely her papa must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
have rolled the little coach along to get her
in that condition.”</p>

<p>“She does more sleeping than anything
else so far in her life,” laughed Max, looking
down admiringly into the sweet, fair baby
face resting so quietly on the soft pillow.</p>

<p>The children, following their parents, had
met them now.</p>

<p>“Oh, we want to see the dear baby!” they
said in excited, but rather hushed, voices.
“Let us look at her, Brother Max.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” he answered. “Let us keep her
asleep as long as we can; then when she wakes
of herself she will probably be in a pleasant
mood. I don’t like to hear a baby cry. Do
you?”</p>

<p>They had reached the house, and the gentlemen
lifted the coach up into the veranda
without waking the young sleeper.</p>

<p>Lucilla was on the veranda, gazing about
from side to side.</p>

<p>“Oh, how sweet the dear old home does
look!” she cried. “I want to go all over this
story and the next just now. May I, father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly, my child. It is your own home
now quite as much as it ever was; because
you are as much as ever my own dear daughter.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for those kind, loving words,
father dear,” she returned with emotion, laying
a hand on his shoulder as she stood at his
side and giving him a look of ardent affection.</p>

<p>At that he bent his head and kissed her on
forehead, cheek and lips.</p>

<p>“It is my turn now, papa,” said Grace
sportively, coming up to his other side.</p>

<p>“So it is, my darling,” he returned, repeating
for her exactly what he had done to Lucilla.</p>

<p>Elsie had noted it all with interest.</p>

<p>“Now, papa, isn’t it my turn?” she asked,
her eyes shining, her lips curling with a smile
of love and entreaty.</p>

<p>“Yes, little daughter, yes, indeed! You
are no less dear than your older sisters. Come
and give and take the caresses papa loves to
exchange with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Violet and Evelyn preferred to keep watch
over the sleeping babe, but all the others
joined in making the circuit of the rooms Lucilla
had expressed a desire to see. They
found them all in good order, Christine being
an excellent housekeeper, and having good
and competent servants under her.</p>

<p>“It is delightful to come home to houses so
well ordered and neat as this and Sunnyside
have proved on this occasion, Mamma Vi,”
Lucilla remarked on her return to the veranda.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think I fully appreciate it,”
replied Violet. “You found yours in good
order?”</p>

<p>“Perfect. It could not have looked better
if I had been there to oversee the work.”</p>

<p>“And I can say just the same of mine,”
said Evelyn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> at Ion the family were left alone, all
the guests having now departed to their own
homes. Zoe was seeing her children in their
nests for the night; Grandpa and Grandma
Dinsmore were chatting together on the front
veranda, while Grandma Elsie and her sons,
Edward and Herbert, a little removed from
the older couple, were engaged in a similar
manner—her sons asking questions in regard
to their mother’s experiences during the summer
and fall, and she telling a pleasant and
interesting tale in regard to them.</p>

<p>Just then a hack came rolling up the avenue.</p>

<p>“Who’s that now, I wonder,” growled Edward,
“coming to interrupt our first private
chat with our long absent mother?”</p>

<p>“Probably somebody wanting the doctor,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sighed Herbert, rising and moving toward the
entrance.</p>

<p>At that moment the vehicle came to a
standstill at the veranda steps, and instantly
out sprang a manly form and came quickly
up them.</p>

<p>“Walter!” exclaimed Herbert, reaching
out his hand, which the other grasped and
shook heartily.</p>

<p>“Yes, brother mine, it is I. Where’s
mother? Mother! mother, dear! Oh, how
glad I am to have you in my arms once
more!” as she sprang forward with a cry of
joy.</p>

<p>“Walter, my dear, dear youngest son!”
and he caught her in his arms. “My baby
boy,” she laughed the next moment; “my
baby boy grown taller than his mother. Oh,
why wasn’t he here to meet and greet me when
I got home?”</p>

<p>“A little business matter, and a misunderstanding
as to the probable time of my mother’s
arrival,” he answered, repeating his caresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they released each other, and joyous
and affectionate greetings were exchanged
with the remaining members of the family.</p>

<p>“You should have been here sooner, Walter,”
said Herbert when all were seated again,
with his mother in the midst. “She
has been telling Ed and me some very interesting
things about her recent visit to California.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps mother will repeat her story to
me one of these days,” said Walter. “At present
it seems almost enough to see her dear
face, without hearing anything but the sound
of her sweet voice.”</p>

<p>“That sounds very much as if my youngest
son had been licking the blarney stone,”
laughed his mother.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, mother,” he returned.
“You know I wasn’t brought up to do such
things.”</p>

<p>“I hope you were not,” she said, “but you
have been under other teachers than your
mother for years past.”</p>

<p>“True, my mother dear, but I hope I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
not forgotten your teachings. Now what is
the latest news about uncles, aunts, cousins
and friends in this neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“I really think but little has taken place
which would be new to you, Walter,” replied
his mother.</p>

<p>“I doubt,” laughed Edward, “if he has
heard of the good fortune of Eva and Max.”</p>

<p>“Money or estate?” queried Walter.</p>

<p>“Something better than either,” remarked
his mother, with a pleased smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose Max has been promoted.
Good for him! He’s very happy over it, I
dare say.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t that. You’re wide of the
mark,” laughed Edward.</p>

<p>“You may as well tell me. I don’t seem
to be Yankee enough to be good at guessing.”</p>

<p>“A little daughter, as pretty a baby as ever
was seen—of course, excepting Zoe’s and
mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that it?” laughed Walter. “Well,
I’ll congratulate them when I see them. Am
I uncle to it, mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” she replied with a smile; “you are
not really related at all to either parent, so of
course not to the child.”</p>

<p>“Yet both the parents and I have been in
the habit of calling each other cousin, so I
think I’ll claim kin with the little beauty you
tell me of.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t think any one will object,”
said his mother.</p>

<p>Zoe now joined them, welcomed Walter
heartily, and the talk went on, principally
about the various relatives and connections,
but with never an unkind or uncharitable
word in regard to any of them.</p>

<p>“And you had them all here to-day,” Walter
said at length. “I wish I had reached
home a few hours sooner.”</p>

<p>“We would all have been glad to see you
then, as we are now, my son,” said his mother.
“But don’t feel too much disappointed. I
have an idea that there will be a number of
other family gatherings before Max is ordered
away again.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Grandma Dinsmore, “I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
several of to-day’s guests express an intention
to have such a family gathering themselves
before very long.”</p>

<p>“And they are the most agreeable kind to
have,” said Zoe.</p>

<p>“I think I shall go to-morrow and have a
peep at that new relative, as well as a chat
with her parents,” said Walter. “I dare say
they feel quite rich. But how funny to think
of the captain and Vi as grandpa and grandma.
But, of course, Vi isn’t really that, and
nobody will think of calling her so.”</p>

<p>“She called herself that,” said Zoe, “but
certainly it seems quite ridiculous. They
will all be sorry, as we are, that you were not
here to-day to take part in our reception,”
she added; “but if you would like to speak
to any of them now, you know you can use the
’phone.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” returned Walter, “but I believe
I should prefer to give them a rousing surprise
to-morrow by just walking in on them.”</p>

<p>“I think that the better plan,” said his
grandfather approvingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“And perhaps I can persuade my mother
to go along,” added Walter, looking smilingly
at her.</p>

<p>“If you get Herbert or Harold to prescribe
the ride—or walk; which is it to be?—I will
go, expecting benefit from so doing,” she responded
in mirthful tone.</p>

<p>“Harold!” exclaimed Walter. “By the
way, where is he? Visiting some desperately
sick patient? I know that’s often the case
when he fails to adorn the family circle.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Herbert; “at present he is
dancing attendance on Grace Raymond, his
adored ladylove.”</p>

<p>Walter laughed and said: “Ah, yes, that’s
all right; Grace is a dear, sweet girl—a beauty,
too; and except for the odd mixing up of
relationships and the fact that she is delicate,
I should be delighted with the prospective
match.”</p>

<p>“I also,” said his mother. “I am very fond
of Grace; have loved her ever since my first
sight of her sweet face. I can see that she
loves Harold dearly, yet is perfectly submissive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to her father’s will in regard to the time
of their marriage. Nor does Harold rebel,
though it is plain to be seen that he longs
for the time when he may claim her as his
very own.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother. Well, I hope he will prescribe
early retirement for his ladylove to-night
and hasten home to greet his youngest
brother, whom he has not seen for nearly a
year.”</p>

<p>“I presume he has done so; for here he
comes now, walking up the avenue,” exclaimed
Herbert, glancing in that direction.</p>

<p>At that Walter sprang to his feet and hastened
forward to meet Harold as he came up
the veranda steps.</p>

<p>“Howdy’do, doctor?” he cried with a
pleasant laugh. “I hope you’ve left that
pretty patient of yours doing well.”</p>

<p>“Why, Walter, my man, I’m glad to see
you and know that, young as you are, you’ve
travelled home safely by yourself,” responded
Harold, reaching the top step and grasping
heartily the hand held out to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you know that I travelled by myself?”
laughed Walter. “Are you quite sure
I may not have a ladylove and future father-in-law
as well as yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my little man; for if you had I
should certainly have learned it before this,
since my youngest brother has always been
communicative to me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that, laddie,” laughed
Walter. “But come along now and join the
family circle, which, with you in it, will be
quite complete.”</p>

<p>“So you are here again, Harold,” said his
grandfather, as they seated themselves.
“How did you and the Raymonds find matters
at Woodburn?”</p>

<p>“Everything in perfect order, sir; at least,
so far as I could tell, and all seemed entirely
satisfied and full of delight that they had at
last reached their home.”</p>

<p>“That is pleasant news. I suppose you
didn’t go on to Sunnyside?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I reserved that pleasant visit for
to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said Walter, “Chester and Lu, Max
and Eva are at home now, I suppose; and
I’m told the latter couple rejoice in owning a
beauty of a baby.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is a beauty, I think,” said Harold;
“as sweet a little creature as ever I
saw.”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty strong, coming from an old
bach, isn’t it?” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“Hardly at an age to be reasonably called
old, Walter,” remonstrated their mother
gently, and with a smile.</p>

<p>“It seems quite well, from a business point
of view, for a doctor to be considered old—or
at least not very young, mother,” said Harold
pleasantly, and with a smile.</p>

<p>“Most people are more ready to trust themselves
and dear ones to the treatment of a physician
who has had some experience in the
practice of his profession, than to one whose
youth proves him to be but a beginner.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, Harold, and very sensible in
those who act upon that principle,” remarked
his grandfather.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> is a lovely morning, one of October’s
fairest days!” exclaimed Lucilla, glancing
from the window of her dressing-room on the
day after their home-coming from their recent
sojourn upon the banks of the Hudson.
“Oh, Chester, my dear, I wish you could just
stay at home and spend the day with me!”</p>

<p>“It would be very pleasant to do so, my
love,” he returned, “but business forbids;
and besides,” he added laughingly, “I feel
very sure you would not be content to really
stay at home all day.”</p>

<p>“No,” she returned in mirthful tone, “but
Woodburn seems to me only a part of my
home—holding my dear father and the other
loved ones—and I cannot be content to refrain
from spending a part of every day with
them, or from having them spend a part here
with me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest, I fully understand, and rejoice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that you have their loved companionship
when I must be away from home, so that you
might be lonely indeed without them,” returned
Chester. He came close to her side
and put an arm about her as he spoke.</p>

<p>“My dear husband,” she murmured low
and softly, “your companionship has become
more and sweeter to me than any or all other,
even that of my dear father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you for those sweet words,
dearest,” he returned with emotion. “Ah, I
esteem myself a very fortunate man in having
such a wife. But it grows late and I
must hasten with my preparations, for breakfast
first and business after.”</p>

<p>“Do, my dear. I am just ready to go
down, and I think the call to breakfast will
soon follow my entrance into the dining-room.”</p>

<p>She met Max in the hall, and they exchanged
a pleasant morning greeting.</p>

<p>“How are wife and baby?” she asked.</p>

<p>“They seem to be well, bright and happy.”</p>

<p>“And you are looking so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look as I feel, then, when I can refrain
from thinking of Uncle Sam’s coming orders,”
he returned with a rather rueful smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I’d break loose from that old
uncle if I were you. Won’t you and Eva
come in and breakfast with us?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you; we were with you last
night, you know, so it’s your turn to come to
us. Take your breakfast with us this morning,
you and Chester, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but Chester is so hurried in
the mornings. I think he would prefer to
join you at tea some of these evenings.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, that will be better. And there!
both breakfast bells are ringing.”</p>

<p>Those sounds brought both Evelyn and
Chester into the hall. Morning greetings
were exchanged with them and the four descended
to their breakfast rooms.</p>

<p>Chester did not linger over his breakfast,
but Max and Eva ate leisurely, as there was
no necessity for haste with either of them at
that time.</p>

<p>Lucilla saw her husband on his way, returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to the table, finished her breakfast,
had a pleasant little stroll about the grounds
with her father, then returned to the house
and found them, baby and all, on the veranda,
for it was a bright, warm morning.
Eva sat with the babe in her arms, Max standing
by her side, gazing in the direction of
Woodburn.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t father come in?” he asked,
his tone expressing disappointment and chagrin.</p>

<p>“He said it was a little too late. Mamma
Vi would be ready for her breakfast, and he
could not think of keeping her waiting. But
he thinks they will be here in an hour or so
and convoy us all over there.”</p>

<p>“All right, as father’s plans always are,”
returned Max with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Just as I think,” said Evelyn; “but I
doubt if we can make a lengthened stay, as
I overheard occasional remarks yesterday at
Ion indicating that we would be likely to receive
a number of calls from relatives and
friends to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“But,” laughed Lucilla, “they will be calling
upon the Woodburn folks, too, and it will
be to them a saving of time and trouble to find
us all in one house.”</p>

<p>“So it will,” responded Max in laughing
tone, “and I hope they will appreciate our
kindness in so evidently consulting their convenience
in regard to the matter.”</p>

<p>“Ah, how sweet our little darling looks this
morning!” exclaimed Lucilla, stepping to
Evelyn’s side and bending over the little one.
“Precious pet, Aunt Lu loves to look at
you.”</p>

<p>“Tell Aunt Lu you will look much sweeter
when you have had your bath and are dressed
for the day,” said Evelyn, and the child
seemed to answer:</p>

<p>“Let me have it soon, mamma, before my
dear grandpa sees me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so you shall,” Eva replied, with a
laughing look at her husband. “Baby dear,
you should appreciate the blessing of having
a father who can talk for you until you can
do it for yourself. Now,” she added, rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
with the child in her arms, “we will go and
make the contemplated improvements.”</p>

<p>“And I to attend to household affairs,”
added Lucilla, and they passed into the entrance
hall together.</p>

<p>The families at Woodburn and Ion sat
down to their breakfast at very nearly the
same time. At both places all were well and
in good spirits, and as a consequence the chat
was lively and pleasant.</p>

<p>“What a lovely morning,” remarked Mrs.
Dinsmore. “This is one of our delicious October
days.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and quite a good deal of it would be
properly spent in walking and driving,” said
her husband. “Shall I take you and Elsie
over to Woodburn and Sunnyside?”</p>

<p>“You may take me in either way that suits
you best,” she returned with a pleased smile.</p>

<p>“And you, Elsie?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Thank you, father,” she said, her tone
and look indicating a grateful appreciation
of his kindness in giving the invitation. “I
last evening accepted an invitation from Walter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
but we might make up a family party
and all go. ‘The more the merrier,’ as I am
sure the Woodburn folk will think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do, do! Let us all go!” cried little
Lily. “I want to see the monkeys again.”</p>

<p>At that everybody laughed, and Grandpa
Dinsmore said:</p>

<p>“Very well, you can visit the monkeys, and
the rest of us our relatives.”</p>

<p>Lily hung her head and blushed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean I cared more about the
monkeys than about aunt and uncle and the
cousins, for I don’t.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, we all understand that,” said
Grandma Elsie soothingly; “the monkeys are
not the principal attraction, but merely an
additional one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” returned the child with a
relieved sigh. “I don’t want anybody to
think I don’t love Aunt Vi and uncle and the
rest, because I do; but the monkeys are the
funniest.”</p>

<p>“Of course, they are,” said her Uncle Herbert;
“and who doesn’t like fun?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know of no one in this house who objects
to it in the right time and place,” remarked
her father, bestowing a reassuring smile upon
the little girl.</p>

<p>“We seem likely to have a gay time while
our young naval officer remains in the neighborhood,”
remarked Mr. Dinsmore.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Edward; “so I understand,
and I hope they—the various parties planned—may
prove enjoyable.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that they will, my dear,”
said Zoe.</p>

<p>“I hope they will be in the daytime, so
that we children can go,” said Lily.</p>

<p>“But even if they do, the monkeys will
surely not be present at all of them,” remarked
Walter gravely.</p>

<p>“But I’m not a monkey, Uncle Walter,”
she returned in a slightly resentful tone.
“You wouldn’t have me for your niece if I
was.”</p>

<p>“No; and you haven’t the least look like
one. So if you can do without their companionship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
I hope you will be permitted to
go to all the parties talked of.”</p>

<p>“If she is a good girl she shall go to all
the parties she’s invited to; all the daytime
ones in the connection, I mean,” said her
mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, mamma!” exclaimed the
little girl; “and I may go to-day with you
and papa, may I?”</p>

<p>“You shall go somehow and with somebody;
we will get it all arranged presently.
There are conveyances enough for all to ride
if they wish, and it is a delightful day for
walking so short a distance if any one prefers
to do that.”</p>

<p>Some did prefer it, and in a few moments
their plans in regard to that were all arranged.</p>

<p>In the meantime Lucilla had made her
housekeeping arrangements and toilet for the
day, the next-door neighbors had done likewise,
the baby, beautifully attired, was sleeping
in her carriage, which Max was proud to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
draw with his own hands, and they set out on
their trip across the lawn to Woodburn.</p>

<p>They received a joyous welcome there, and
were told they were just in time to prevent
the call from being made in the other direction.</p>

<p>“We were just about to start for Sunnyside,”
said Violet, “for we were all hungry
for a sight of my little granddaughter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, she isn’t that, and you don’t
look a bit like a grandmother!” exclaimed
Elsie.</p>

<p>“I’m her own grandfather’s wife,” laughed
Violet, “and what’s my husband’s is mine
also. Isn’t it, my dear?” turning to him
with a pleased little laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “I consider you as having
a right to a share in all my possessions.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice and kind in you, papa,” said
Elsie, “but I don’t like my pretty young
mamma to be thought old; and folks will
think so if she’s called grandma.”</p>

<p>“Well, daughter, I should think a sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
her face would convince anybody of the absurdity
of that,” the captain said, drawing
Elsie to his side and smoothing her hair caressingly.
Then bending over the babe, which
was waking, he said caressingly: “Grandpa’s
pretty pet! the first grandchild, sweet and
beautiful as a lily or a rose.”</p>

<p>At that she looked up into his face and
cooed.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty reply to grandpa, baby
darling,” he said, softly touching her cheek
with his lips.</p>

<p>Then she seemed to speak:</p>

<p>“I love you, my dear grandpa.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nice for her to say,” cried Elsie,
clapping her hands and laughing merrily;
“and I do believe she does, papa, for see
how sweetly she looks at you. Oh, I think
she’s just the dearest, prettiest baby that ever
was made.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather strong, isn’t it?” laughed
Max; “but you are young and have seen comparatively
few of her age.”</p>

<p>“I really think a brighter or prettier one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
would be hard to find,” said her grandfather.</p>

<p>“And it wouldn’t be worth her father’s
while to pretend to disagree with me,” he
added, glancing at Max with a twinkle of
fun in his eye.</p>

<p>“We are not disposed to contradict you,
father,” Evelyn said with a smile, “but perhaps
it is partly because she is our very own
that she looks so pretty to us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are some folks coming up the
driveway!” exclaimed Ned. “Why, they are
grandma and Uncle Herbert and—Uncle
Walter, I do believe!”</p>

<p>“And I think you are right,” said his
father, then hurried forth to meet and welcome
the approaching guests. Violet followed
closely in his footsteps, the others a little
more slowly.</p>

<p>Warm greetings were exchanged, then
came a gathering about the carriage, and Evelyn
and Max were gratified by hearing
Walter say he really thought it the prettiest
young baby he had ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so far she’s as good as she is pretty,”
said Lucilla; “a bit bairnie to be proud
of.”</p>

<p>“There’s nobody here who will contradict
you in that,” said Violet, gazing admiringly
upon the sweet baby face.</p>

<p>“She seems a fortunate little one—has
come to the right place, I think,” remarked
Herbert.</p>

<p>“Yes, the right place to be loved and petted,”
said Violet. “I suppose partly because
we have had no baby among us for some
years.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad we have one now, and that she’s
my little niece, the dearest, prettiest baby in
the land!” cried Elsie, bending over the
child and regarding it with loving admiration.</p>

<p>“Where’s Harold?” asked Violet. “I wonder
he didn’t come with his mother and brothers.”</p>

<p>“Gone to visit some patients who have been
longing for his return,” replied Herbert;
adding laughingly: “They actually appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
think him a better physician than either Cousin
Arthur or myself. I presume he will be
in after a little, though. And yonder, I see,
come grandpa and grandma, with Ed and his
family.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is well,” said the captain; “the
more the merrier.”</p>

<p>The new arrivals met a hearty welcome,
spent a delightful half hour, then returned
to Ion; but had scarcely left Woodburn when
a servant came to tell the Sunnyside folk that
callers were there awaiting the return of its
owners.</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Max.</p>

<p>“The folks from the Oaks and Beechwood,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, just our own connections,” said Lucilla;
“so, father, you, Grandma Elsie,
Mamma Vi and the rest, you will accompany
us, won’t you? I think it would be pleasant
for us all.”</p>

<p>Evelyn and Max added their urgent invitation,
and all accepted except Herbert, who
excused himself on the plea that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
were patients whom he ought to call upon
promptly.</p>

<p>Max and his wife and sister found their
callers seated upon the veranda at Sunnyside,
enjoying a view of the beautiful grounds, and
chatting cosily together while awaiting their
coming.</p>

<p>Cordial greetings were exchanged, the baby
was noticed and admired, and some one
asked if she could still talk as well as she did
yesterday.</p>

<p>“Can’t you, my pet?” asked her father,
leaning over her, and an answer seemed to
come from her lips:</p>

<p>“I’ll try, papa, if you will help me.”</p>

<p>“I really think she can talk now quite as
well as she did yesterday,” Max said with
becoming gravity.</p>

<p>“And I presume she will be able to whenever
her father is with her,” laughed Violet.</p>

<p>“And when he is gone, perhaps she may
succeed when Cousin Ronald is by,” said the
captain. “I shall certainly not be surprised
if she does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“It probably will not be so very long before
she can use her own tongue,” said Mr. Lilburn.</p>

<p>“And we will hope she will use it aright as
she grows up to girlhood, and then to womanhood,”
remarked her grandfather, gazing affectionately
upon the little one now nestling
in her mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“Your first grandchild, is it not, sir?”
asked Mr. Lilburn, addressing the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “and her coming has
given me some serious thoughts about my increasing
years. I believe I am growing an
old man.”</p>

<p>“Not so very,” laughed Cousin Ronald,
shaking his head. “I have been a grandsire
for years, and when I began the business
I was older than you are now.”</p>

<p>“And to me he doesn’t seem so very old
even yet,” Annis said with an affectionate
smile.</p>

<p>“That sounds pleasant, coming from the
lips of my bonny young wife,” Mr. Lilburn
said, returning her smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a momentary silence, then the
old gentleman went on in a meditative
tone:</p>

<p>“Life in this world has many blessings and
many trials, but the Bible tells us, ‘As thy
days, so shall thy strength be,’ and in my experience
that promise has been fulfilled many,
many times. Friends, the day after to-morrow
is the Sabbath. Suppose we meet together,
as we were wont to do in the past, and
have ‘strength’ as the subject for the Bible
lesson. I invite you all to come to Beechwood
for that purpose.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Captain Raymond,
speaking for all, “but allow me to offer Woodburn
as the place for meeting, it being
more central and—so near this—better
suited to the entertainment of my little granddaughter,
whose parents would hardly like to
go leaving her behind.”</p>

<p>Cousin Ronald laughed at that.</p>

<p>“No; and that would be a bad lesson to begin
her education with—the keepin’ her oot
o’ the Bible class. I’m not particular where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
our class shall meet, and Woodburn will suit
me as well as any ither place.”</p>

<p>Just then there were arrivals from Fairview
and the Laurels, which caused the subject
to be dropped for the time. But it was
taken up again after a little, and Woodburn
finally settled upon as the place for the next
Sunday’s Bible class.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fine weather continued; Sunday was
bright and beautiful—the woods gay with
autumn tints, the air balmy and sweet with
the scent of late fruits and flowers. The Ion,
Fairview, Roselands, Beechwood, Woodburn,
Sunnyside and the Laurels people went to
church in the morning, and in the afternoon
most of them gathered at Woodburn to spend
an hour in the study of the Bible, Mr. Ronald
Lilburn being the leader of the class.</p>

<p>“Our subject to-day,” he said, “is the
strength the Lord promises and gives to His
people—His own loved ones, His servants, in
their hours of need. ‘As thy days, so shall
thy strength be.’ Captain Raymond, can you
bring to our attention any other promise of
strength as it is needed?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the captain; “here in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
fortieth chapter of Isaiah we read: ‘Hast thou
not known? Hast thou not heard that
the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator
of the ends of the earth, fainteth not,
neither is weary? There is no searching of
His understanding. He giveth power to the
faint, and to them that have no might He increaseth
strength. Even the youths shall
faint and be weary, and the young men shall
utterly fall: but they that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength; they shall mount
up with wings as eagles; they shall run and
not be weary; and they shall walk and not
faint.’”</p>

<p>“A most beautiful passage,” said Mr. Lilburn,
“and now, friends, I think each one of
you has one or more passages selected; please
read aloud in turn as you sit, without waiting
to be called upon.”</p>

<p>Violet’s turn came next, as she sat beside
her husband, and she read: “I will love Thee,
O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock,
and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler
and the horn of my salvation, and my
high tower.”</p>

<p>Her mother sat next, and she read: “The
Lord is my strength, and He will make my
feet like hinds’ feet, and He will make me to
walk upon mine high places.... This
day is holy unto the Lord: neither be ye
sorry: for the joy of the Lord is your
strength.”</p>

<p>Then Grace read: “The king shall joy in
thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation
how greatly shall He rejoice.”</p>

<p>Then Lucilla read: “Unto thee, O my
strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
and the God of my mercy.”</p>

<p>“Seek the Lord and His strength: seek His
face evermore,” read little Elsie.</p>

<p>Then Harold: “I can do all things through
Christ who strengtheneth me.”</p>

<p>Then Herbert: “Trust ye in the Lord forever;
for in the Lord, JEHOVAH, is everlasting
strength.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Max: “Let him take hold of any
strength, that he may make peace with Me;
and he shall make peace with Me.”</p>

<p>Then Evelyn: “Strengthened with all
might, according to His glorious power, unto
all patience and long suffering with joyfulness.”</p>

<p>The others said their selected texts had
been read.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, then Mr. Lilburn
said:</p>

<p>“I think it altogether likely that every one
present who has gone past the meridian of
life could tell of personal experience of the
fulfilment to her or himself of that gracious,
precious promise, ‘As thy days, so shall thy
strength be,’ and I, for one, should be very
glad to hear their testimony to our Heavenly
Father’s faithfulness to His promise.”</p>

<p>A moment’s silence, then the captain said:</p>

<p>“And you, Cousin Ronald, being the eldest
and our chosen leader, might well be the
first with your story of the Lord’s goodness
to you, and faithfulness to His promises.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am entirely willing,” the old gentleman
returned pleasantly. “The Lord has been exceedingly
good to me through all the years of
my life. I have had very many troubles,
trials and difficulties, but His grace and the
many great and precious promises of His
Word have helped me through them all. I
have seen the grave close over wife, children,
parents and friends, but have been sustained
under the sore trial by the glad hope of meeting
them all in that better land where there is
no more death, no sin, no parting, but all is
righteousness and peace and joy forevermore.</p>

<p>“And even in this world the Lord has given
me much to repair my losses and renew the
joys of my younger days,” he added with a
very loving look and smile directed to Annis.</p>

<p>She returned the smile and spoke in low,
pleasing tones:</p>

<p>“I, too, have had some sore trials, and can
testify to the Lord’s faithfulness to His promise,
‘As thy days, so shall thy strength be.’
Years ago my heart was torn with grief over
the deaths of parents, brothers, sisters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
other dear ones. There have been other trials
also, but the Lord’s promise has never failed.
He has brought me safely through them all,
and is making my later days my best days—full
of peace, comfort and happiness.”</p>

<p>It was now Mrs. Elsie Travilla’s turn, as
she sat next to her Cousin Annis. She spoke
in low, sweet tones, distinctly audible in the
quiet of the room:</p>

<p>“I give my testimony to the Lord’s faithfulness
to that gracious promise, ‘As thy
days, so shall thy strength be.’ I never knew
a mother’s love and care, for mine died when
I had been but a few days in this world; and
my father was so far away that it seemed
much as if I had none. But I was in the
care of those who taught me of Jesus and His
love as soon as I could understand the meaning
of the words; and while yet a very little
child I learned to know and love Him. I
loved my home, too, and it was a sore trial to
be brought away from it. Then, when I first
saw my father and perceived that he did not
care for me, my heart was almost broken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
only the love of Jesus helped me to bear
it.</p>

<p>“That trial was soon happily over; but
later in life sore bereavement came, the nearest
and dearest being called away from earth.
But even then strength was given me according
to my day; and while grieving for myself,
I could rejoice for them. And these
later days are, oh, so full of peace and joy
and love!”</p>

<p>Harold sat near his mother, and was the
next to speak:</p>

<p>“I have as yet seen no very great trials,
but in going into the recent war with Spain I
felt that I was risking life and limb; but the
Lord sustained me with the thought that I
was doing so for the sake of oppressed and
suffering fellow-creatures, and with that
thought came strength according to my day.”</p>

<p>“And my experience was the same,” added
Herbert.</p>

<p>“Mine also,” said Max. “When we went
into the fight at Manila I feared wounds and
death, but I knew we were in the right—fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
to free the downtrodden and sorely oppressed,
and, knowing that the Lord had the
disposal of it all, I had strength given me according
to my day. Now you, dearest,” he
added in an undertone to his wife.</p>

<p>Eva said in low, gentle tones:</p>

<p>“I have seen sorrow, losing my dear, passionately
loved father before I had grown to
womanhood; but my strength was according
to my day, the Lord comforting me with His
love, and as wife and mother, and having a
kind father, brothers, sisters and friends, I
am now a very happy woman, indeed.”</p>

<p>A slight pause, then Captain Raymond
spoke.</p>

<p>“I have had many, many blessings and
some trials also. My dear father died when
I was a young lad, my best of mothers when I
had scarcely more than reached man’s estate;
brother and sisters had gone from earth also,
and I was left alone, with small means, but
good health. I was still quite a young man
when I met a sweet young girl who had been,
like myself, bereft of all her nearest relatives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
We loved and married, but I had to leave her
often, sometimes for long intervals, for the
duties of my profession. We were very happy
when together, but in a few years she left
this world for a better, and the three children
God had given us to my sole care, though
I had to be away most of the time upon the
sea. I have since found one to take her place—one
as dear and loving as she was herself,”
he added with a look and smile directed to
Violet that thrilled her heart with joy and
love.</p>

<p>It was her turn now, and she began at once:</p>

<p>“I have had a peaceful, happy life, both as
a young girl and as a married woman, though
some deep sorrows came to me years ago;
first the death of a darling younger sister,
then that of the best and dearest father that
ever lived.” Her voice trembled with emotion,
but she went on. “But then in those sad
hours was fulfilled to me that precious promise,
‘As thy days, so shall thy strength be;’
and though I feel it to be only reasonable to
expect other and greater trials in the future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
I can trust my Heavenly Father to fulfil it to
me again and again till I reach that blessed
land where there is no more sin or sorrow or
suffering.”</p>

<p>No one else in the room made any lengthened
response to the invitation to tell of the
fulfilment to them of the gracious promise
“As thy days, so shall thy strength be,” merely
saying that they believed it and trusted in
it for the future, but as yet had had no very
great trials.</p>

<p>Then Violet went to her organ, played a
short prelude and began singing a hymn, in
which all joined:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In every condition, in sickness, in health,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In poverty’s vale, or abounding in wealth,</span></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> whole connection seemed filled with a
desire to entertain their returned travellers,
especially Max, whose present stay among
them would be but short. And that the baby
might accompany its parents, the gathering
together of the relatives and friends was always
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>On Monday they took dinner and spent
the afternoon at the Laurels, on Tuesday at
the Oaks, Wednesday at Roselands, Thursday
at Beechwood, and there the younger
ones had great sport, Cousin Ronald and Max
helping them.</p>

<p>They were all on the veranda after dinner,
chatting pleasantly among themselves, when
Ned exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s have some fun on the lawn! We
may play there, mayn’t we, Cousin Ronald?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“You may, Cousin Ned,” answered the old
gentleman with a pleased smile, “and mayhap
I’ll tak’ a turn wi’ ye, if I’m not deemed
sae auld as to spoil the sport.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think it would be fun for us to have
you with us, sir!” cried Ned. “Now, how
many of you boys and girls would like to join
in a game of ‘I spy’?”</p>

<p>In reply to that query all the children present
immediately expressed a desire to take
part in the game, and they promptly adjourned
to the grounds. All were familiar
with the game.</p>

<p>“Now who shall be the one to hide his
eyes?” asked Ned, his look and tone of voice
showing a desire to fill the position himself.</p>

<p>That was evident to the others, and two
or three of the cousins said at once:</p>

<p>“You, Ned; you’ll do as well as any other.”</p>

<p>So, the base being chosen, Ned covered his
eyes and the others scattered and hid behind
bushes, trees and summer houses. Then from
every direction came the cry “All Ready!”
and Ned’s eyes were instantly uncovered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
away he ran, looking about him searchingly
from side to side.</p>

<p>Presently catching a glimpse of a familiar
coat worn by his cousin Eric Leland, “I spy
Eric Leland!” he shouted. “I’ll beat you
in to base,” then turned and ran back to the
chosen base—the lower step of the front veranda.</p>

<p>Both boys ran as fast as their young legs
could carry them, but Ned reached the base
and Eric became “It.”</p>

<p>Directly after these two came all the others
engaged in the game, and just as the last
one had reached the goal there came an angry
growl, apparently from under the veranda.</p>

<p>“How dare you rude youngsters come
tramping and stamping here in this rude
way? It’s enough to kill a man with a headache
like mine, and I wont stand it. Clear
out, every one of you.”</p>

<p>For a moment the children seemed thunderstruck,
then they began asking each other
in awed, frightened tones:</p>

<p>“Who is it? and where is he? Is there a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
room for him under there? and will he come
out and fight us?”</p>

<p>Then all at once Ned, Elsie and the cousins
from the Oaks and Fairview began to
laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Cousin Ronald or Max, and we
needn’t be a bit afraid,” they said.</p>

<p>But at that the voice spoke again:</p>

<p>“I a relation of yours? Think I’d own any
o’ you for relations o’ mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do think so,” replied Ned stoutly.
“I know you’re either Cousin Ronald or
Brother Max, and whichever you are I’m not
a bit afraid of you, because you’re both as
good and kind as ever you can be.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk,” replied the voice.
“You are a pretty good boy, I perceive. So
go on with your play, and if you don’t make
a racket here and hurt my head I’ll not interfere
with you.”</p>

<p>“Where is your head, cousin or brother,
whichever you are?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“On my shoulders, saucebox,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>At that all the children laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Ned. “Mine is at
the top of my neck.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep it there,” said the voice.
“Now run off to your play, all o’ ye, and leave
me in peace to nurse my head and get rid of
the ache.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ned, “but first I’m going to
look for Cousin Ronald and Brother Max,
because I’d like to know which has been trying
to cheat us and pretending to scold.”</p>

<p>He straightened himself and looked earnestly
along the veranda as he spoke. Evidently
the company there had been listening
to what was going on and enjoying the sport,
Cousin Ronald and Max among them. Captain
Raymond was there, too, standing at the
top of the steps and looking as if he had been
having a share of the fun.</p>

<p>“You are having a good deal of fun, aren’t
you, my young friends?” he asked. “To hear
and see it all makes me rather hungry for a
share of it. Would you object to my joining
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no! No, indeed!” cried several
young voices. “Please come; we’ll be glad to
have you.”</p>

<p>So the captain stepped down and joined
them.</p>

<p>That started the older people. Not only
Mr. Lilburn and Max hastened to join the
players, but Chester and Lucilla, Dr. Harold
and Grace, Dr. Herbert and Dr. Arthur
Conly.</p>

<p>They all seemed to renew their youth, entering
heartily into the sport, to the great delight
of the children, the two ventriloquists
increasing it by the use of their peculiar talent.
Sometimes the players were surprised
and puzzled by voices, unlike any of theirs,
calling from different quarters, but presently
the more knowing ones would give a merry
shout that would open the eyes of the others
to the fact that it was only a ventriloquial
trick for their amusement.</p>

<p>When they grew tired of “I spy” other
games were tried with success, and it was only
as the time for going home drew near that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
they ceased their sport and rejoined the older
members of the party upon the veranda.</p>

<p>Evelyn was sitting there with her baby on
her knee, and many of the children gathered
about her, saying they wanted a bit of fun
with her—the baby—before going home;
wanted to hear her talk.</p>

<p>“But she is too young to talk,” said Evelyn;
“she will hardly be able to say anything
for months to come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, her father can make her talk,”
laughed Eric; “if he tells her to, she’ll mind
him. Won’t you, baby dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. Babies ought to do what their
papas tell them to.”</p>

<p>The words seemed to come from the little
lips, and the children turned to see if Max
was near. He was, and smiled in response
to their questioning glances.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t she do pretty well for so young a
talker?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, with her father to help her,”
laughed Eric. “But I’m afraid she won’t be
able to do so well when you are away on shipboard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Unless Cousin Ronald is somewhere
near,” he added, as an after thought.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like Cousin Ronald,” the baby
voice seemed to say.</p>

<p>“And you love your aunties, don’t you?”
asked Elsie Raymond, leaning over her.</p>

<p>“Yes, I love you and all the other ones.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you love your cousin doctor,
who takes care of you and mamma when you
need him?” asked Dr. Harold, joining the
group.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! Will you be my uncle some
day?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” laughed Harold. “You will
make a nice little niece, I think.”</p>

<p>“And I think he will be a nice uncle,”
laughed Grace, who was standing by his side.</p>

<p>Captain Raymond, too, was near, the baby
being as attractive to him as to any one else—except,
perhaps, the parents.</p>

<p>“I should like to be able to prove that very
soon,” said Harold with a significant glance
at the captain.</p>

<p>At that Grace blushed and gave her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
a loving, entreating look that seemed to
say:</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry with us, father dear. I
love you, and we are not rebellious.”</p>

<p>“‘Patient waiting no loss,’” he said with
kindly look and smile. “I love my daughter
too well to be in a hurry to give her away.”</p>

<p>“What will you do when your papa goes
away to his ship, baby?” asked Eric.</p>

<p>“Stay at home with mamma,” was the reply,
at which the children all laughed.</p>

<p>But now the carriages were at the door,
and they must hasten to prepare for their
homeward drive.</p>

<p>It was but a short one from Beechwood to
Woodburn, and to that hospitable home went
not only the immediate family, but the Sunnyside
folk also, Grandma Elsie and her sons,
Harold and Herbert.</p>

<p>An inviting tea was ready for them on
their arrival, and after it they had a delightful
social evening together, music and
conversation making the time pass very
swiftly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>But the guests were all disposed to retire
to their homes at a reasonably early hour;
first, however, they sang a hymn together;
then the captain read a portion of Scripture,
and led them in a prayer full of love and
gratitude for the numberless blessings that
sweetened their lives. Then the good-nights
were said and the outsiders departed to their
homes. But there was no sadness in the partings,
for all expected to meet again in a few
hours.</p>

<p>When Grace came to her father for the
usual good-night caress he took her in his
arms and held her close.</p>

<p>“My own darling daughter,” he said low
and tenderly, “you don’t know how dear, how
very dear you are to your father. Millions
could not buy you from me.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear papa, it is very sweet to have
you love me so,” she responded in tones trembling
with emotion, “and I think my love
for you is as great as yours for me.”</p>

<p>“Yet you want me to give you away?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; only to take another son as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
partner in the concern when you think the
right time has come,” she answered, smiling
up into his face.</p>

<p>At that he gave her a smiling caress.</p>

<p>“So I will when I think that time has
come,” he said, “but till then I hope you can
be happy in my home, under my care, and
loved and petted as one of my own God-given
children.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I can, papa, and I shall never,
never be willing to go too far away to see and
talk with you every day.”</p>

<p>“That is pleasant for me to hear,” he said,
“and I hope to keep you in this home with me
even after you exchange my name for another;
and if you and Harold grow tired of
that I think I can find room on this estate
for another dwelling, not inferior to Sunnyside,
put it up and furnish it for my second
daughter, who is not to be treated with any
less favor than her elder sister and brother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, how good, good you are to me!”
she exclaimed low and feelingly. “I am so
glad and thankful that I was born your child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
But I should love to be that even if you were
poor and couldn’t do anything for me.”</p>

<p>“I believe you would, my darling,” he returned.
“But now bid me good-night and
go; for it is time you were resting, after all
the excitement and fatigues of the day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, papa, dear, dear papa,” she said,
putting her arms around his neck and kissing
him with ardent affection, “you are so kind
to me, and, oh, how I do love you! I
wouldn’t marry even Harold, whom I dearly
love, if I knew that he would take me far
away from you.”</p>

<p>“Nor could I be willing to give you to him
if that was to be the result. But there seems
little or no danger of that, as his home and
near connections are in this neighborhood and
he seems to have no desire to leave it. My
greatest objection to the match is the mixture
of relationships it will bring about. You,
my own daughter, will be my sister-in-law,
and Harold son-in-law to his sister. Still,
as there is no blood relationship between you
two, and you seem so devotedly attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
each other, I have not felt that I had any
right to forbid the match.”</p>

<p>“Yes, papa, and you were very, very kind not
to do so; for dearly as I love Harold, I would
never marry him without your consent.”</p>

<p>“No, I know you would not, my darling,
for I have not a more obedient, bidable child
than you. But I must not keep you longer
from your needed night’s rest.”</p>

<p>Then laying his right hand gently upon
her head, he gave her the fatherly blessing
Lucilla loved so well: “The Lord bless thee
and keep thee; the Lord make His face
shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee;
the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee
and give thee peace.”</p>

<p>“Dear papa, thank you,” she said with
emotion, glad tears in her eyes. “I do love
that blessing, and I hope you will have it as
well as I.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, daughter,” he said; “nothing
could be better for either of us. And I am
exceedingly glad that he who has won your
young heart is a Christian man.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Max</span> and Evelyn were in their own Sunnyside
home, leaning over their sleeping babe,
their faces shining with love and joy.</p>

<p>“The darling!” exclaimed Max, speaking
low and tenderly. “She seems to me the dearest,
loveliest child that ever was made.”</p>

<p>“To me, too,” returned Eva with a low and
sweet laugh, “though I know that is because
she is yours and mine; and there must have
been very many others quite as beautiful and
sweet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, no doubt; and I suppose it is because
she is our very own that she seems so wonderfully
attractive and lovable to me. And
yet she seems to be so to others not related to
her.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, Max, and my heart sings for
joy over her; and yet we cannot tell that she
will always be an unmixed blessing, for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
do not know what her character in future life
may be. Oh, Max, we must try to train her
up aright, and we must pray constantly for
God’s blessing upon our efforts; for without
His blessing they will avail nothing.”</p>

<p>“No, dearest, I am sure of that, and my
darling little daughter will be always remembered
in my prayers. That will be almost
all I can do for her in that line, as my profession
will call me almost constantly to a distance
from home. You, dearest, will have
to bear the burden of her training and education;
except such parts as money can procure.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” Evelyn replied in
moved tones, “and you must pray for me
that I may have wisdom, grace and strength
according to my day.”</p>

<p>“That I will, dear wife; and we will converse
every day by letter, shall we not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and you shall know as well
as written words can tell you how baby grows,
and looks, and learns. And she shall know
her papa by seeing his photograph and hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
a great deal about him from mamma’s
lips.”</p>

<p>“It is pleasant to think of that,” Max said
with a smile. “And of my home-coming,
which I hope will be rather frequent, as we
are at peace and I am likely to be on some
vessel near the shore of this, our own land.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so!” exclaimed Evelyn. “How
I shall look and long for your coming! Ah,
I envy those women whose husbands are always
at home with them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, some of them would be glad
if they weren’t. Unfortunately, all marriages
are not the happy ones that ours is;
some husbands and wives have little love for
each other, little enjoyment in each other’s
society.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my dear, that is a sad truth,” sighed
Evelyn; “and our mutual love and happiness
in each other is still another cause for gratitude
to God.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and I thank Him every day—and
many times a day—for the dear, lovable
wife He has given me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“As I do for my best and dearest of husbands,”
she said in response.</p>

<p>“And oh, what a number of dear relatives
and friends our marriage has given me!
Friends they were before, but not really relatives.
I am so glad to be able to call your
father, sisters and little brother mine. It is
so sad to have no near relatives.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel that it must be, though I have
not known it by experience, having always
had my dear father and sisters, Lu and Grace.
But now, dearest, it grows late and you are
looking weary. Had you not better get to
bed as quickly as possible?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, thoughtful husband; it has
been quite an exciting day and I am weary,”
she said, turning from the cradle to him, her
eyes shining with love and joy.</p>

<p>After Grace had said good-night and retired
to her own apartments the captain and
Violet sat chatting together in the library for
some time. It was quite past their usual
hour for retiring, when at length they went
up to their bedroom. The door was open between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
it and the next room, which had formerly
been occupied by Grace, but was now
given up to Ned, he having graduated from
the nursery, much to his own gratification.
He considered it plain proof that he was no
longer a baby boy, but a big fellow hastening
on toward manhood.</p>

<p>“I have been feeling somewhat anxious
about our little boy,” Violet said in an undertone
to her husband, while laying aside her
jewelry, “he was so flushed and excited while
getting ready for bed. Oh, hark, how he is
talking now!”</p>

<p>She paused in her employment and stood
listening, the captain doing likewise.</p>

<p>“I got to the base first, and it’s your turn
to be ‘It,’ Eric!” Ned called out in excited
tones.</p>

<p>Tears started to Violet’s eyes as she turned
toward her husband with a questioning, appealing
look.</p>

<p>“I fear he is indeed not well,” returned the
captain, moving toward the open door. “We
will see what can be done for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Violet followed. The captain lighted the
gas and both went to the bedside. Ned was
rolling and tumbling about the bed, muttering
and occasionally calling out a few words
in regard to the game he imagined himself
playing.</p>

<p>“Ned, my son,” the captain said in soothing
tones, “you are not at play now, but at
home in your bed. Try to lie still and sleep
quietly.”</p>

<p>The captain took the little hot hand in his
as he spoke. He was surprised and alarmed
at its heat, and that the little fellow did not
seem to know where he was or who it was that
spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Levis, the child is certainly very ill,”
said Violet in low, trembling tones. “Would
it not be well to ’phone for one of my doctor
brothers? I am sure either of them would
come promptly and cheerfully if he knew our
boy was ill and we wanting advice for him.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a doubt of it, dearest, and I will
go at once to the ’phone,” replied the captain,
leaving the room, while Violet leaned over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
her little son, smoothing the bedclothes and
doing all she could to make him more comfortable.</p>

<p>At Ion most of the family had retired to
rest, but Harold had lingered over some correspondence
in the library, and was going
quietly up the stairway when he heard the
telephone bell. He went directly to the instrument,
saying to himself a trifle regretfully:</p>

<p>“Somebody wanting the doctor, I suppose.
Hello!” he called, and was instantly
answered in Captain Raymond’s unmistakable
voice:</p>

<p>“I am glad it is you, Harold, for we want
you badly, as soon as you can come to us.
Ned is, I fear, very ill; has a high fever and
is quite delirious.”</p>

<p>“I will come at once,” returned Harold.
“Poor, dear little chap! His uncle loves him
too well to let him suffer a moment’s illness
that he may possibly be able to relieve.”</p>

<p>As Harold turned from the instrument his
mother’s bedroom door opened and she stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
there arrayed in a dressing-gown thrown hastily
over her night-dress.</p>

<p>“What is it, Harold, my son?” she asked.
“I heard the telephone. Are any of our dear
ones taken sick?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be troubled, mother dear,” he returned
in tenderly respectful tones. “It was
only a call from Woodburn to say that little
Ned is not well and they would like me to
come and do what I can for him.”</p>

<p>“And you are going?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, with all haste.”</p>

<p>“I should like to go with you, to do what
I can for the child and to comfort poor
Vi.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, mother! Please go back to
your bed, take all the rest and sleep that you
can and go to them to-morrow. That is your
eldest doctor son’s prescription for you.
Won’t you take it?” putting an arm about her
and kissing her tenderly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, returning the caress with
a rather sad sort of smile, “for I think he is
a good doctor, as well as one of the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sons.” And with that she went back to her
bed, while he hurried away to his patient.</p>

<p>It was an anxious night to both him and
Ned’s parents, and the morning brought little,
if any, relief to them or the young sufferer.</p>

<p>Chester and his wife were breakfasting
cozily together that morning, when Captain
Raymond walked in upon them unannounced.</p>

<p>“Father!” cried Lucilla, springing up and
running to him. “Good morning. I’m so
glad to see you. But—oh, father, what is the
matter? You look real ill.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she held up her face for the
usual morning kiss.</p>

<p>He gave it with affection, then said in
moved tones:</p>

<p>“Your little brother is very, very ill. Harold
and we have been up with him all night.
He is no better yet, but we do not give up
hope.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so, so sorry!” she sighed, tears
filling her eyes. “He is such a dear little fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and has always been so healthy that I
have hardly thought of sickness in connection
with him.”</p>

<p>Chester had left his seat at the table and
was standing with them now.</p>

<p>“Do not despair, captain,” he said with
feeling; “all is not lost that is in danger, and
we will all pray for his recovery, if consistent
with the Lord’s will.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the effectual, fervent prayer of the
righteous man availeth much, and the Lord
will spare our dear one if He sees best,” returned
the captain feelingly.</p>

<p>“Father dear, you look so weary,” Lucilla
said with emotion. “Let me do something
for you. Won’t you sit down to the table and
have a cup of coffee, if nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, daughter. Perhaps it would
help to strengthen me for the day’s trials and
duties,” he replied, accepting the offered seat.</p>

<p>They were about leaving the table when
Max came in.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, father, sister and brother,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
he said, looking about upon them with
a grave, concerned air. “I have just heard
bad news from one of the servants—that my
little brother is very ill. Father, I hope it is
not true?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Max, my son, to have to say
that it is only too true,” groaned the captain.
“We have been up with him all night, and
he is a very sick child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is sad indeed! Can I help with
the nursing, father, or be of service in any
way?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, indeed; but come over all
of you, as usual, to cheer us with your presence,
and perhaps make yourselves useful in
some other way.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I shall be glad to do anything
I can to help or comfort; but—if our
baby should cry, might it not disturb poor
little Ned?”</p>

<p>“I think not; we have him in the old
nursery. Her cry, if she should indulge in
one, would hardly reach there, and if it did
he is not in a state to notice it. So come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
over as usual; the very sight of you will do
us all good.”</p>

<p>“I was going into town as usual,” said
Chester, “but if I can be of any use—”</p>

<p>“Your help will not be needed, with so
many others, and you can cheer us with your
presence after you get home in the afternoon,”
returned the captain in kindly, appreciative
tones. “Are Eva and the baby well,
Max?” he asked, turning to his son.</p>

<p>“Quite well, thank you, father, and you
will probably see us all at Woodburn in an
hour or so.”</p>

<p>With that Chester and the captain departed.</p>

<p>At Ion, Mrs. Elsie Travilla came down to
breakfast evidently attired for a drive or
walk. No one was surprised, for the news
of Ned Raymond’s serious illness had already
gone through the house, causing sorrow and
anxiety to the whole family.</p>

<p>Herbert, too, was ready for a drive, and
presently after leaving the table took his
mother over to Woodburn in his gig. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Conly also arrived about the same time, having
been telephoned to in regard to the illness
of his young relative.</p>

<p>Several days followed that were sad ones
to not only the immediate Woodburn and
Sunnyside families, to whom little Ned was
so near and dear, but to the other more distant
relatives and friends. All of them were
ready and anxious to do anything and everything
in their power for the relief of the
young sufferer and to comfort and help the
grieved and anxious parents.</p>

<p>But Harold’s skill and knowledge of the
disease and the most potent and effectual
remedies did more than all other human
means to remove it and restore the young lad
to health. Harold was at length able to pronounce
his young patient free from disease
and on a fair road to entire recovery of
health. Violet embraced her brother and
wept for joy, while the father and sisters—the
older brother also—were scarcely less
glad and thankful.</p>

<p>“Come into the library, Harold, and let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
have a little private chat,” the captain said,
in tones husky with emotion.</p>

<p>For some moments they sat in silence, the
captain evidently too much moved to command
his voice in speech. But at length he
spoke in low, trembling tones.</p>

<p>“Brother Harold, dear fellow, I can never
thank you enough for saving the life of my
little son;—you were the instrument in the
hands of God our Heavenly Father. Money
cannot pay the debt, but I should like to
give a liberal fee as an expression of the gratitude
felt by us all, especially your Sister Violet
and myself.”</p>

<p>There was emotion in Harold’s voice also
as he answered:</p>

<p>“My dear brother, don’t forget that it was
not so much your son as my own dear little
nephew I was working to save. Thank you
heartily for your desire to reward me with
a liberal fee, but I feel that I can well afford
to use all the knowledge, strength and skill I
possess for the benefit of my dear ones without
any payment in ‘filthy lucre;’ but, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
dear brother, there is one reward you could
give me which I should be far from despising—which
I should value more than a mint
of money, or any amount of stocks, bonds or
estate.”</p>

<p>He paused, and after a moment’s silence
the captain spoke:</p>

<p>“You mean my daughter Grace? Surely,
you forget that I long ago consented to the
match.”</p>

<p>“If I would serve for her as Jacob did for
Rachel; but I want her now, and if you will
give her to me directly I will watch over her
with all the care and solicitude of both a devoted
husband and physician; and I think
you will find that marriage will not break
down her health. Has not that improved under
my care? and may we not hope to see
still greater improvement when she is my
dear devoted wife?—for she does love me,
unworthy as I am.”</p>

<p>The captain sat for a moment apparently
in deep thought. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Being of the medical profession, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
ought to know better than I what will be
likely or unlikely to injure her health. I believe
you to be thoroughly honest and true,
Harold, and if such is your opinion, and you
are willing to live here in this house for at
least the first year, and afterward in one that
I shall build for you and her on this estate,
you may have her in a few months. You
know, she will want a little time for the preparation
of her trousseau,” he added with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Thank you, captain, thank you with all
my heart!” exclaimed Harold, his face aglow
with happiness.</p>

<p>At that moment Grace’s voice was heard
speaking to some one in the hall without.</p>

<p>The captain stepped to the door and
opened it.</p>

<p>“Grace, daughter,” he said, “come here
for a moment. Harold and I have something
to say to you.”</p>

<p>She came immediately, blushing, smiling,
a look half of inquiry, half of pleased expectation
on her sweet and lovely face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Her father, still standing by the door,
closed it after her, took her hand, drew her
into his arms and kissed her tenderly,
fondly.</p>

<p>“My child, my own dear child,” he said,
“I have given you away, or promised to do
so as soon as you can make your preparations
and—want me to give up my right in you
to another.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, papa, not that,” she returned, her
eyes filling with tears; “am I not your very
own daughter? and shall I not always be, as
long as we both live?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, indeed, my own precious darling,
and this is to be your home still for at least
a year after—you drop my name for Harold’s.”</p>

<p>“I shall never drop it, father, only add to
it,” she returned, with both tears and smiles.</p>

<p>Harold stood close beside them now.</p>

<p>“And you are willing to share mine, dearest,
are you not?” he asked, taking her hand
in his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, since I have your dear love,”
she answered low and feelingly.</p>

<p>“And I think he has been the means of
saving your dear life, and now your little
brother’s also,” her father said with feeling,
“so I cannot refuse you to him any longer,
my darling, sorrowful thing as it is to me to
give you up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t give me up, dear father, don’t!”
she entreated with pleading look and tone.
“Surely, I shall not be less yours because I
become his also.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear child, I shall surely be as
much your father as ever. Shall I not, Harold?”</p>

<p>“Surely, sir; and mine also, if you will accept
me as your son.”</p>

<p>Violet came to the door at that moment.</p>

<p>“May I come in?” she asked; “or would
that be intruding upon a private interview?”</p>

<p>“Come in, my dear; we will be glad to have
you,” replied her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>She stepped in and was a little surprised
to find the three already there standing in a
group together.</p>

<p>It was Harold who explained.</p>

<p>“Congratulate me, sister; I have got leave
to claim my bride as soon as she can make
ready for the important step.”</p>

<p>“Ah? Oh, I am glad, for you richly
deserve it for what you have done for our
precious little Ned.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sister,” Harold said with
emotion, “but give God the praise. I could
have done nothing had He not blessed the
means used.”</p>

<p>“True; and my heart is full of gratitude to
Him.” Then, turning to Grace: “I am very,
very glad for Harold to be, and feel that he is,
rewarded, but, oh, how shall I ever do without
you—the dearest of dear girls?”</p>

<p>“I have not yet consented to her departure
from her father’s house,” said the captain,
turning a proud, fond look upon his daughter,
“but have stipulated that we are to have
them here in this house for at least a year;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
then in another to be built upon this estate—if
they wish to leave us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like that!” exclaimed Violet. “It
removes all objections—except with regard
to the mixture of relationships,” she added
with a slight laugh. “But I am forgetting
my errand. Ned is awake and asking hungrily
for his father and his doctor.”</p>

<p>“Then we must go to him at once,” said
both gentlemen, Grace adding:</p>

<p>“And I, too, if I may, for surely he would
not object to seeing his sister also.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Violet, “and the sight
of your dear, sweet face, Gracie, could not,
I am sure, do anything but good to any one
who sees it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, mamma, I fear you are becoming a
flatterer,” laughed Grace. “But it must be
for father or the doctor to decide my course
of conduct on this occasion.”</p>

<p>“You may come, if you will promise not to
say more than a dozen unexciting words to
my patient,” Harold said in a tone between
jest and earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“I promise,” laughed Grace. “It seems I
have to begin to obey you now.”</p>

<p>“I think you began a year or two ago,” he
returned laughingly. “You have been a very
satisfactory patient.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” she said. “Father,
have I your permission to go with you to take
a peep at my little sick brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, daughter, if you will be careful to
follow the doctor’s directions.”</p>

<p>“I will, father, first following in his and
your footsteps,” she said, doing so along with
Violet as the two gentlemen, having passed
into the hall, now began mounting the broad
stairway.</p>

<p>They found the young patient lying
among his pillows, looking pale and weak.
His eyes shone with pleasure at sight of
them.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve all come,” he said feebly.
“I want a kiss, mamma.”</p>

<p>She gave it and bent over him, softly
smoothing his hair. “Mother’s darling,
mother’s dear little man,” she said in trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
tones, pressing kisses on his forehead,
cheek and lips.</p>

<p>“There, Vi dear, that will do,” the doctor
said gently. “Let the rest of us have our
turn. Are you quite easy and comfortable,
Ned, my boy?” laying a finger on his pulse
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes, uncle. Give me a kiss, and then let
papa and Grace do it.”</p>

<p>“Be very quiet and good, my son; do just
as uncle tells you, and you will soon be well,
I think,” the captain said in cheery tones
when he had given the asked-for caress.</p>

<p>Then Grace took her turn, saying:</p>

<p>“My dear little brother, get well now as
fast as you can.”</p>

<p>Then the doctor banished them all from the
room, bidding them leave him to his care and
that of the old mammy who had again and
again proved herself a capital nurse in the
family connection.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> captain, Violet and Grace now returned
to the library, where they found Lucilla
at the typewriter answering some letters
for her father.</p>

<p>“Oh, you have all been up to see Neddie,
haven’t you?” she asked, judging so by the
expression of their faces.</p>

<p>“Yes, daughter,” replied the captain, “but
the doctor would allow only an exceedingly
short call, and so much depending upon it,
we must all be careful to follow his directions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, the dear little brother!” she
exclaimed with emotion. “But surely something
pleasant has happened to you, Gracie
dear, for you are looking very happy.”</p>

<p>“As I am and ought to be,” returned Grace,
blushing vividly; “father and the—and others,
too, have been so kind to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, father means to reward Harold, does
he?” laughed Lucilla. “Well, sister dear, if
you like it I am glad for you.”</p>

<p>“Your father has, indeed, been very kind
to our pair of lovers,” said Violet, smiling
upon both her husband and Grace, “and the
best of it is that he has stipulated that they
are to stay here with us for the first year of
their married life.”</p>

<p>“After that to remain on the estate, but in
a separate house if they wish it,” added the
captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, how nice!” cried Lucilla; “and Harold
really deserves it.”</p>

<p>“As does Grace also,” said their father,
“for she has been sweetly submissive to her
father’s will.”</p>

<p>“It would have been strange if I had been
anything else toward such a dear, kind father
as mine,” she said, regarding him with an
expression of ardent affection, which he returned,
smiling fondly upon her.</p>

<p>The door opened and Max stood upon the
threshold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“Am I intruding?” he asked, pausing
there.</p>

<p>“No, my son; we wish to have no family secret
from you. Come in and join us,” replied
his father, and Max stepped in, closing the
door behind him.</p>

<p>“You are all looking happy,” he said,
glancing about upon them with a pleased
smile, “and no wonder; it is such good news
that our dear little Ned is convalescing.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lucilla, “and I think Gracie
here is somewhat rejoiced over Harold’s
promised reward.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I suppose I know what that is,” said
Max, glancing at the blushing, half smiling
face of his younger sister. “You are to be
‘It’ this time, aren’t you, Gracie?”</p>

<p>Her only reply was a low, sweet laugh, but
their father answered:</p>

<p>“Yes, I have withdrawn my objection to a
speedy union, as I felt that Harold deserved
a great reward, and he preferred that to any
other.”</p>

<p>“And when is it to be?” asked Max.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“When she has had time to prepare her
trousseau.”</p>

<p>“And I fear that will take so long that I
shall miss the sight,” sighed Max.</p>

<p>“Don’t despair, son; you or I may be able
to get an extension of your leave of absence,”
said his father.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, father, if they do not delay too
long.”</p>

<p>“But we could hardly have a grand wedding
now while Neddie is so ill,” said Violet;
“especially as Harold is his physician.”</p>

<p>“It needn’t be a grand wedding, mamma;
I should prefer a quiet one,” said Grace; “but
I am certainly in no hurry about it.”</p>

<p>“You must have a handsome wedding dress
and trousseau,” said Violet. “And we want
Max here at the wedding, and don’t want
Harold to leave our dear little boy till he is
fairly on the road to recovery. Now, how
shall we manage it all?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps your mother might help in the
arrangement,” suggested Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Harold would want to tell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
himself of—the change of plans,” said the
captain.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened and
mother and son appeared on the threshold,
both looking very cheery and bright.</p>

<p>The captain sprang to his feet and hastened
to bring forward an easy-chair, while Violet
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, I am so glad you have
joined us! I was just on the point of going
to ask you to do so.”</p>

<p>“I suppose to tell me the good news I have
just heard from Harold,” was the smiling rejoinder.
“But he was the one to tell it,
daughter. And captain,” turning to him, “I
thank you for the change in your decision in
regard to a most important matter, which
Harold feels to be a great reward for what he
has been enabled to do for our dear little
boy.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad I had it in my power to do
something to show my appreciation of his invaluable
services,” the captain said with evident
emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is Eva?” exclaimed Lucilla. “She
should be here with us on this important occasion.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is one of the family,” assented
Captain Raymond heartily.</p>

<p>“I will go and
bring her,” said Max, hurrying from the
room, to return in a very few minutes carrying
his baby and with his wife by his side.</p>

<p>The little one was cooing and smiling.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, friends and relatives, for
bringing in this uninvited young girl, for I
can assure you she will not repeat anything
that is said,” laughed Max as Eva took possession
of a chair handed her by Harold, and
he gave the child to her. The door opened
again at that moment and Elsie Raymond’s
voice was heard asking:</p>

<p>“May I come in, papa?”</p>

<p>“Yes, daughter, you are wanted here,” was
the pleasant-toned reply, and as she came
near to him he drew her to his knee, saying:</p>

<p>“We are talking of Grace’s wedding, trying
to decide when it shall be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it going to be soon, papa?” she exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
“I thought it wasn’t to be for years
yet. And I don’t want my dear Sister Grace
to be taken away from us to another home.”</p>

<p>“No, and she shall not be for a year or
more, and then not out of the grounds.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am glad of that! You will build
them a house in our grounds, will you, papa?”</p>

<p>“I hope to do so,” he said. “But now you
may listen quietly to what others are saying.
Mother,” turning to Mrs. Travilla, “I think
we can hardly yet set the exact date for the
ceremony that will give you a daughter and
me a son. We will want our little Ned to
be well enough to enjoy the occasion, and to
spare his doctor for a wedding trip of more
or less length.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I agree with you in that. Perhaps
Christmas eve would be a suitable time
for the ceremony; Neddie will probably be
well enough by then to be present; and if
bride and groom want to take a trip, Herbert
and Cousin Arthur Conly can give any attention
or prescriptions needed during Harold’s
absence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t forget, mother, that it is the groom’s
privilege to fix the month,” exclaimed Violet.
“And, Harold,” turning to him, “please don’t
let it be so early as Christmas, because I want
Grace here then. It would hardly seem like
Christmas without her.”</p>

<p>“How would New Year’s day do for the
ceremony?” suggested Lucilla.</p>

<p>“Much better than Christmas,” said Violet.</p>

<p>“So I think,” said the captain. “They are
both too soon to suit my desires, but—I have
already relinquished them.”</p>

<p>“It would be the best New Year’s gift you
could possibly bestow upon me, captain,” said
Harold.</p>

<p>“But what is your feeling about it, dearest?”
he asked in an undertone, bending over
Grace as he spoke.</p>

<p>“If you are suited, I am satisfied,” she returned
in the same low key, and with a
charming smile up into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I, for one, like the New Year’s gift idea,”
said Evelyn. “Gracie to give herself to Harold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
as such, and he himself to her as the
same.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a pretty idea,” assented Grandma
Elsie; “but, as Vi has reminded us, it is
Harold’s privilege to set the month, but Gracie’s
to choose the day.”</p>

<p>“New Year’s would suit me better than any
later day, but I want my ladylove to make the
choice to suit herself,” Harold said, giving
Grace a look of ardent admiration and affection.</p>

<p>“I like Eva’s idea,” she said with a blush
and smile, “so am more than willing to say
New Year’s day, if that suits you, Harold;
that is, if—if dear little Ned is well enough
by that time to attend and enjoy the scene.”</p>

<p>“I think he will be,” said Harold; “at all
events, if we have the ceremony performed
here in this house.”</p>

<p>“I should prefer to have it here rather than
anywhere else,” said Grace with gentle decision.</p>

<p>“I, too,” said Harold.</p>

<p>“Then let it be understood that such is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
be the arrangement,” said the captain. “And
in the meantime, Grace, daughter, you can be
busied about your trousseau, shopping and
overseeing the dressmakers.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, father dear,” she said; “but
I have abundance of handsome wearing apparel
now, and shall not need to get anything
new but the wedding dress.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Violet, “you must
have a handsome travelling dress and
loads of other nice things; and as soon as
Neddie is well enough to be left by us for
some hours we must go to the city and do the
necessary shopping.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added the captain, “remember that
your father wants you to have all that heart
could wish for your trousseau, if—if he is
handing you over to another rather against
his will.”</p>

<p>“I trust I shall never give you cause to regret
it, sir,” said Harold pleasantly. “But
I must go now to my young patient,” he
added, rising to his feet. “Adieu for the
present, friends. I know that you can arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
remaining matters without my valuable
assistance.”</p>

<p>With that he left the room, and the talk
between the others went on.</p>

<p>Harold was pleased to find his young patient
sleeping quietly. The improvement in
his condition was steady from that time, so
that in another week it was deemed altogether
right and wise to begin preparations for the
approaching nuptials.</p>

<p>Relieved from anxiety about little Ned,
and supplied by the captain with abundant
means, the ladies thoroughly enjoyed the necessary
shopping, and daily brought home an
array of beautiful things for the adornment
of the bride that was to be. At the same time
Max returned to his vessel, but with the
promise of another short leave of absence to
enable him to attend the wedding. That
made it easier to part with wife and baby for
the time.</p>

<p>Here we will leave our friends for the present,
preparations for the wedding going merrily
on, the lovers very happy in each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and the bright prospect before them, the captain
not very discontented with the turn
events had taken, and Grandma Elsie full of
quiet satisfaction in the thought of Harold’s
happiness, and that she herself was to have
so sweet a new daughter added to her store of
such treasures.</p>
